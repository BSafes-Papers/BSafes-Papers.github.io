## CHAPTER 3: RESULTS

### Dating App Use Experiences and Expectations

Of the total (*N* = 230) participants, 144 (62.6%) participants reported they currently use or have used dating apps, and 85 (37.0%) participants reported never using dating apps. One additional participant had missing data for the full survey. Of the 144 participants who are using or have used dating apps, 141 (98.0%) participants have messaged someone else on a dating app, and 103 (71.5%) participants have met someone in person from a dating app. When asked yes/no questions about their personal dating app experiences, 59% of users have felt uncomfortable interacting with someone on a dating app, 28.5% have felt unsafe when messaging someone from a dating app, and 20.1% have felt unsafe when meeting someone from a dating app. Dating app users were asked about their expectations when signing up on dating apps where 58% expected something bad or uncomfortable to occur, 39.6% expected some form of sexual harassment, and 91% think unwanted sexual advances are common on dating apps. When asked how appropriate they think unwanted sexual advances are on dating apps, 59.7% of dating app users think it is not appropriate at all, 29.2% think it is slightly appropriate, 8.3% think it is moderately appropriate, and 2.8% think it is always appropriate for dating apps.

### Sexual Violence and How It Was Experienced

Participants who reported current or past use of dating apps (*n* = 144) were directed to answer the TFSV-V scale items. This scale is used to record how many times a participant experienced specific sexually violent behaviors via dating apps. Including all items in the TFSVV scale, 88.8% of dating app users reported yes for at least one item. The full TFSV-V scale is also divided into four sections; first, the digital sexual harassment section contains items about unwanted sexual behavior experienced by electronic means, and the image-based sexual abuse section contains items about receiving nonconsensual sexually explicit images. Third, the sexual aggression and coercion section contains items about becoming a sexual assault victim via online platforms as well as items about blackmail or distribution of someone’s sexually explicit images. Finally, the gender/sexuality-based sexual harassment section contains items about receiving unwanted hate or comments about gender or sexual orientation. For each section of the scale, 88.1% of dating app users reported digital sexual harassment, 37.8% reported image-based sexual abuse, 42.0% reported sexual aggression/coercion, and 49.7% reported gender/sexualitybased sexual harassment.

The study also found differences in the frequency of dating app facilitated sexual violence based on participants’ gender and sexuality. Women (*M* = 1.613, *SD* = 0.508) experienced dating app facilitated sexual violence more frequently than men (*M* = 1.227, *SD* = 0.237). The overall model was significant *F*(1,140) = 27.835, *p* < 0.001. The average frequency of dating app facilitated sexual violence was higher in all four sections for women compared to the average frequency reported by men. Based on gender, digital sexual harassment had the largest difference in average frequency of dating app facilitated sexual violence. The frequency of digital sexual harassment for women (*M* = 1.976, *SD* = 0.654) was higher compared to the frequency for men (*M* =1.420, *SD* = 0.384). The overall model was significant *F*(1,140) = 32.557, *p* < .001.

Additionally, participants who identified as a sexual minority (*M* = 1.630, *SD* = 0.567) experienced dating app facilitated sexual harassment more frequently than heterosexual/straight participants (*M* = 1.413, *SD* = 0.420). The overall model was significant *F*(1,140) = 5.611, *p* = .019. The average frequency of dating app facilitated sexual violence was higher in all four sections for sexual minorities when compared to the average frequency reported by heterosexual/straight participants. Based on sexuality, digital sexual harassment was the section with the largest difference in average frequency of dating app facilitated sexual violence. The frequency of digital sexual harassment for sexual minorities (*M* = 2.031, *SD* = 0.719) was higher compared to the frequency for heterosexual/straight participants (*M* = 1.676, *SD* = 0.576). The overall model was significant *F*(1,140) = 8.417, *p* = .004.

All participants, who have used dating apps or not, were directed to answer the SES-SFV scale. This measure was used to record sexual violence that occurred, after the age of 14, apart from dating apps. 36.7% of participants reported at least one instance of adult sexual violence outside of dating apps using behaviorally specific language. Additionally, when participants were explicitly asked in a follow-up question if they had been raped, 8.0% reported yes.

Of all participants who reported at least one incident of sexual violence, via dating apps and/or outside of dating apps, (n = 107) answered the PTSD measure. Some participants who previously reported at least 1 instance of sexual violence in the TFSV-V scale or the SES-SFV scale reported they had not done so in a follow-up question. Their answer to this follow-up question could have been a mistake, misinterpretation of the question, or another unknown reason, but their answer inhibited their access to the PTSD measure. Of the 107 participants who completed the PTSD measure, after reporting sexual violence, only 101 participants explicitly reported how they experienced their trauma. Of the 101 participants, 9 (8.9%) experienced sexual violence only via dating apps, 52 (51.5%) experienced sexual violence outside of dating apps, and 40 (39.6%) experienced sexual violence both on and off dating apps. The sample size for participants who experienced sexual violence only via dating apps is too small to make significant statistical comparisons between the other two groups. Means and standard deviations of each mental health measure score separated by how sexual violence was experienced (i.e., via dating apps only, outside of dating apps, vs. both) is reported in Table 4.

### Dating App Facilitated Sexual Violence and Mental Health

Participants who reported current or past use of dating apps responded the technology facilitated sexual violence victimization (TFSV-V) scale and multiple mental health measures. The total score of the TFSV-V scale relates the frequency of sexual violence experienced on dating apps. The data results showed that TFSV specific to dating apps was a significant predictor of mental health symptoms for PTSD, depression, anxiety, self-esteem, loneliness, and perceived self-control (See Table 3).

#### *Sexual Violence on Dating Apps and PTSD*

A linear regression analysis was conducted with dating app facilitated sexual violence frequency predicting symptoms of PTSD. The overall model was significant, *F*(1, 78) = 31.308, *p* < .001, *R*<sup>2</sup> = 28.6%. Therefore, TFSV specific to dating apps was a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms, *B*(*SE*) = 1.011 (0.181), *t*(78) = 5.595, *p* < .001, indicating that the greater frequency of TFSV on dating apps was associated with more severe symptoms of PTSD.
