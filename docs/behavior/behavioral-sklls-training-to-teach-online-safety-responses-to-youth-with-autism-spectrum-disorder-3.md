## Results
Figure 1 shows the participant’s performance during baseline, BST, and posttest assessments. During baseline the highest safety score earned by the participant was a score of 1 (i.e., he abstained from providing personal information). Safety scores higher than 1 were earned by the participant abstaining from providing personal information and performing one or more of the other steps of the safety-response sequence. Each additional safety response the participant performed (e.g., saying “No”, pausing game, or telling an adult) increased his safety-score rating by one point per additional response. In baseline, the participant provided his address during the third IRPI probe. The participant’s safety scores increased during BST. On the 10th trial the participant reached the performance criterion.

The posttest results depicted in Figure 1, indicate the participant’s performance did not maintain after BST. Across the initial three probes, the participant’s performance was similar to baseline. On the fourth probe the participant earned a safety score of 2 (i.e., abstained from providing name and replied “no”). Similar to Johnson et al. (2005), IST was then provided to the participant between the fourth and fifth probes. Immediately following the implementation of IST, the participant earned the maximum safety score of 4.
