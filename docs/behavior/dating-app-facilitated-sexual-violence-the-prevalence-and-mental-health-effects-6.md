## CHAPTER 5: STRENGTHS, LIMITATIONS, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

A strength of this research survey is the thoroughness of questions regarding various forms of sexual violence. Items within each measure targeted online and offline behaviors that affect a victim’s physical, emotional, and societal life. Many items asked for specific experiences, which an everyday person may not recognize as sexual harassment, so they can be answered without the pressure of a label or social connotation. Participants were not only asked about their sexual violence experiences in detail but were also asked about their general experiences and expectations while using dating apps. Questions regarding their views on dating apps, their expectations about sexual harassment prior to using dating apps, and their views on what behavior is appropriate on dating apps were asked. These responses allow for more insight on the topic of technology facilitated sexual violence. The various mental health measures also included a wider range of symptoms and indicators. Many studies focus on depression and anxiety, but this study also included questions about PTSD, self-esteem, loneliness, and perceived self-control which can all provide insight on participants’ mental health. Additionally, this study was able to be taken by participants online, thus participants could choose any time or location and have privacy to report or think about the difficult trauma surrounding sexual violence and mental health.

On the other hand, a weakness in this research is that some mental health questions may cause biased underreporting. Another weakness of this research study is how sensitive or taboo sexual violence can be. While participants are allowed to skip questions, exit the survey, and take the survey in private, some participants may feel uncomfortable answering questions about traumatic sexual experiences or feel uncomfortable if their experiences have never been previously shared. The disclosure of sensitive information, even when anonymous, may lead to participants underreporting incidents of sexual violence for personal or emotional reasons. Finally, this research assesses the effects of mental health at various and unknown times from the date of the trauma. Therefore, the level and frequency of certain symptoms regarding PTSD, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and self-esteem are only known at the time the study was taken. A longitudinal study is important in future research to have a more thorough understanding of the immediate and long term-effects for each mental health measure. In this survey, most participants who experienced sexual violence via dating apps also experienced offline sexual violence. The individual impact for each trauma is difficult to separate and analyze, so longitudinal research may be able to find their differential impact if participant’s mental health is studied before and after sexually violent experiences.

### Implications for Future Research 

Future research on the frequency and mental health effects of dating app facilitated sexual violence is necessary for all current and future victims. Dating app use is growing considerably and becoming a more normative way of meeting partners or forming relationships. Therefore, future research can raise awareness of the frequency of sexual violence via dating apps as well as the mental health effects and even physical effects. Many people may not think of sexual violence experienced online as being as impactful, hurtful, or traumatizing, but this research shows that the effects of dating app facilitated sexual violence are important. Increased awareness and understanding can allow for better care and support among members of society toward victims of dating app facilitated sexual violence. Additionally, officially labeling specific actions like the sending of unsolicited sexual images (which is commonly reported on dating apps) as sexual violence, can help reduce its normalization.

On a medical and clinical perspective, future research can outline the immediate and long-term health effects of sexual violence experienced via dating apps. This can allow for better health care and prepare mental health providers to start specific treatment plans or techniques when patients report such experiences. By knowing the health effects of TFSV, health providers can be better equipped to help/treat victims who report those behaviors.
