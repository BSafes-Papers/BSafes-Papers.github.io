## Introduction
Among the software development community and possibly the rest of the professions, AI has become a popular topic, but what is AI? The following research is meant to help examine more precisely what AI is. Most people use some form of AI every day, whether they recognize it or not. Although individuals use AI very often, there are ethical concerns surrounding the use of AI. Do not read the following without understanding that there are many benefits of AI, but the ethical concerns are real and need to be addressed. Unless these concerns are studied, and regulations are implemented, AI could grow unchecked. If AI grows unchecked, the issues will soon outweigh the benefits.
