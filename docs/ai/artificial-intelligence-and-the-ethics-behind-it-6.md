## Social Media – A Doppelganger in the Cloud
Social media has changed the landscape of the American culture. People can now be connected to others across the country. In the blink of an eye, thousands of people can see a post by a user. In this age, information is shared quickly without a filter. Most of these services are free. Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter are all free services; granted, some do have premium features. How do social media giants offer their services for free?

### Social Media Profits
Most people are able to easily sign up for a social media account and use it for free. The companies behind these platforms have to be making money, but how? Advertising. Every user's activity online is recorded. This data is then shared with advertisers. When a user searches for "Nike shoes" on Google, in many cases, an ad appears on Instagram or any other social media site. AI is used to help create powerful ads containing "Nike shoes" and then place the ad on an individual’s social media feed at the right time [31]. By creating ads that are more efficiently targeted towards their audience, social media giants are able to charge companies more to advertise on their platforms. 

### Data Collection/Privacy
The issues of artificial intelligence and data privacy run parallel to each other. Companies try to collect as much data as they can for each user so that they can provide more targeted advertisements with the help of AI. At first, the use of AI in advertising does not seem to have adverse effects; however, the issue at hand is the type and amount of data collected by social media platforms about each user. Companies keep track of how long a user stays focused on individuals' posts/advertisements, what the user "likes," what videos they watch, and so on. By keeping track of all this data, social media platforms have a digital copy of their users. It has been said that social media knows individuals better than they know themselves. A simple, similar example of how this is true is discussed during a Ted Talk. During the talk, speaker Jennifer Golbeck recalls a scenario involving Target

> A 15 year old girl had received coupons from Target in the mail for baby products two weeks before she had even told her parents that she was pregnant. How did Target know she was pregnant? Target keeps track of their customers and what they purchase. By doing this they are able to compare purchases to thousands of other purchases. By comparing this data, they are able to find common patterns. They then take those patterns and suggest what the user might buy [32].

In the same manner, social media platforms keep track of all of its users’ data and are able to use that data to hyper-target ads to users. This can influence the user's purchases more than they realize. The EU has taken steps to implement user privacy. One study found "display advertising became far less effective at changing stated purchase intent after the EU laws were enacted, relative to display advertising in other countries" [33]. Social users need to decide how much information they are willing to give up to use social media and other resources for free. To make sure that tech giants are not taking advantage of consumers, there also needs to be regulations established concerning the use of individuals’ data and integration with AI-led marketing.

##### The Future of AI
AI has continued to grow over the past few years. Throughout this growth, the benefits that AI can contribute to society, companies, and governments can be seen. These benefits could save lives; however, it is not without risk. There are many ethical concerns surrounding AI, so the future of AI should be considered carefully.

##### Humans In Control of AI
It is important to realize that as AI grows, humans need to be able to remain in control of AI. The Pew Research Center performed a study and found five concerns involving the evolutions of humans and AI:

1. The use of AI reduces individuals' control over their lives 

1. Surveillance and data systems designed primarily for efficiency, profit and control are inherently dangerous 

1. Displacement of humans’ jobs by AI will widen economic and digital divides, possibly leading to social upheaval 

1. Individuals’ cognitive, social and survival skills will be diminished as they become dependent on AI

1. Citizens will face increased vulnerabilities such as exposure to cybercrime and cyberwarfare that spin out of control… [34]

All of the issues above represent an AI future where humans are controlled by AI rather than AI is controlled by humans. "Controlled" in this sense does not mean forced. Contrastingly, it just represents a relationship between AI and humans where humans are dependent on AI to lead functioning lives. There are a few ways to help mitigate the risk of AI controlling humans.

1. Implement rules across nations on how AI should be used. Doing this creates a common ground and keeps individual countries from developing AI that could harm society. 

1. Limit AI where possible. AI has many useful benefits, but as AI becomes more prevalent, humans will begin to decrease in their functionality. Limiting AI applications prevents humans from becoming unable to perform common tasks. 

1. Shift towards prioritizing humans’ improvement.

One of the individuals that responded to the Pew Research survey, Byron Johnson- CEO of Kernel, said 

> I strongly believe the answer depends on whether we can shift our economic systems toward prioritizing radical human improvement and staunching the trend toward human irrelevance in the face of AI. I don't mean just jobs; I mean true, existential irrelevance, which is the end result of not prioritizing human well-being and cognition [34].

Byron Johnson highlighted the fact that by using AI for repetitive and minuscule tasks, humans will have the ability to learn more relevant things. If society neglects to improve human intelligence and functionality, the end result of AI could prove to be catastrophic.

### AI’s Roadmap
Artificial intelligence has proven its benefits along with its ethical issues. It has already brought many benefits in health care, transportation, the environment, criminal justice, and economic inclusion [35]. Although it is impossible to predict the future, from the trend of AI, it appears that AI will continue to grow. As people become more aware of how AI can invade their privacy, they may change their minds. However, many people are willing to trade-off privacy for convenience. Michael Roberts, CEO of ICANN, suggests- "The record to date is that convenience overwhelms privacy. I suspect that will continue" [34].
