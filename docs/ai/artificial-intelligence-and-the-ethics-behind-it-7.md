## Conclusion
A hundred years ago, people would have only dreamed of what artificial intelligence could do. From research, developers have been able to build complex systems to aid humans, companies, and governments. In trade for these benefits, individuals have given up privacy and other certain abilities. The full scale by which AI has changed the world cannot be fully understood. The immediate benefits and dangers can be seen, but not the less-noticeable areas of influence. Some of the most challenging concerns facing AI include privacy and the possibility of what AI might look like in the future. This has raised many ethical concerns. Without proper discussion and regulation, there is no indication of how AI will be controlled in the future. In conclusion, this research was meant to discuss the benefits that AI provides and the ethical concerns. From those concerns, there should be a call to discuss the future of AI to ensure that society and individuals can function independently of AI.
