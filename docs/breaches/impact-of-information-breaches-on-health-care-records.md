## Abstract

Although there were almost 3.5 million reported information breaches of health care data in the first quarter of 2019, health care providers do not know the extent of digital and nondigital breaches of patient medical records. The purpose of this quantitative, comparative study was to identify the difference between the individual patient records affected by digital versus nondigital breaches for three types of health care entities in the United States, health care providers, health care plans, and health care clearinghouses. Allman’s privacy regulation theory, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Privacy Framework, and ecological systems theory comprised the theoretical framework. The focus of the research questions was on the difference between digital and nondigital breaches for each of the health care entities. The study data consisted of 2,601 digital and nondigital breach reports for the three healthcare entities for the years 2010 to 2018 retrieved from the public database of HIPAA breach and violations maintained by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Significant t tests of the hypotheses for each health care entity indicated that more breaches occurred digitally than nondigitally, and that health plan provider breaches resulted in a greater number of individuals impacted per incident than breaches of healthcare providers or healthcare clearinghouses. The implication for positive social change is that the study findings may help health care entities make better decisions about how to allocate scarce information security resources to lower health care costs by reducing the breaches of health care records.

## Dedication
I dedicate this research study to my wife, Abini Cross, for her love, unwavering support, and patience during my long journey. I also dedicate this to my daughter, Amy Anton. My doctoral journey started during the same year when Amy was born. We both grew together and shared beautiful memories during this long journey. Amy has been a motivational force for me to complete my doctorate.

I also would like to dedicate this study to my brother, Frank Duff, who has suffered from hydrocephalus all his life and always reminds me of the importance of healthcare in our community. I also would like to thank my parents, Antoni and Anuncia, who emphasized the importance of education since my childhood.

I also dedicate this study to my mentor, Ramon Collante; without his support, for which I will forever be thankful, this journey would not have been possible. Above all, I am thankful that God has showered his blessings and strength on me during my doctoral journey and all my life.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge Dr. Aridaman K. Jain, my chair, for his continued support and motivation during this whole process. I would also like to thank Dr. Robert Levasseur, my second committee member, for his guidance in shaping this dissertation to be aligned with the required elements. I also would like to thank my first, second committee member, Dr. Thomas Spencer, who helped during the initial phases of this journey until his retirement. I would like to acknowledge Robert James Babin Sr., Chief Information Security Office at Saint Peter’s Healthcare System, and Dr. Capecomorin Pitchumoni for their inspiration in initiating this study based on the HIPAA security breaches.

I would like to extend my thanks to the Information Technology leadership members, William Rears, Dr. Jordan Tannenbaum, and Frank DiSanzo, from Saint Peter’s Healthcare System for their support during this doctoral journey. In addition, I would like to thank the Human Resources department at Saint Peter’s Healthcare System, especially Pam Teufel and Susan Ballestero, for facilitating the scholarship, which greatly helped during this long journey.
