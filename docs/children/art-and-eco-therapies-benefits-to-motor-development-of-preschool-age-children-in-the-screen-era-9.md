## Discussion
The purpose of the study was to illustrate the benefits or potential benefits that art therapy together with ecotherapy can have on supporting motor development of preschool-age children in the context of our highly technological society. In this study, we approached the topic by doing a literature review that explored the intersection of the topics of art therapy, art, ecotherapy, nature-based therapy, outdoor play, preschool age, and motor development.

Nature-based expressive arts was selected because of its theoretical groundings. Naturebased expressive arts therapies are intermodal, meaning it uses more than one way to help individuals in their therapeutic goals. Second, nature-based expressive arts therapies are informed by indigenous perspectives and deep ecology. Lastly, its theories are biocentric, meaning the field values not just human life, but all life. These are important because they align with ecopsychology theories and bring into the practice of art therapy an ecological consciousness that is essential to help both person and earth. In addition, it facilitates the adaptation of the practice regardless of place and the needs of the individuals involved in the therapeutic process.

In this literature review, it was found that art therapy and ecotherapy not just work well together but are an emergent field called nature-based expressive therapies or eco-art therapy. Because the field is new, there is still research needed on the integration of both practices. In the research, it was found that art therapy and ecotherapy both individually and together (eco-art therapy) have a positive impact in the area of motor development as well as general well-being for preschool-age children. This is important because motor skills are essential. They are necessary for performing daily tasks such as writing, buttoning a shirt, and running (Minuci, 2019).

Studies also connect motor skills to cognitive development, academic achievement, and self-esteem. Deficiencies in motor skills can result in anxiety and even depression in older children and teenagers due to their struggles or perceived struggles in areas that require motor skills they might be lacking (Morrow, 2015). Excess screen time has been associated negatively with motor skill development (Oswald, 2020). The extra time spent on-screen activities takes time from activities that naturally help children develop their motor skills such as playing outdoors or art-making. In contrast, research found that time in nature can help mitigate the effects of excess screen time as nature promotes movement and play which in turn helps with motor skill development.

Both art and nature promote creativity sparking children’s curiosity and imagination which helps enhance the learning process. Within the therapeutic context, this can help facilitate learning new skills, such as fine and gross motor skills, as children learn better organically through play. Children can engage in art-making with finger paint, watercolor and brushes, crayons, clay, mud, twigs, stones, and other natural materials, all of which can help with motor skill development. Children can also use art and natural materials to build things and bring to life places and objects of their imagination. While doing these activities children will naturally engage and use large and small muscle groups that will help them develop both fine and gross motor skills. In the context of the pandemic where children are spending more time indoors and in front of screens, therapists can help balance out the effects of excess screen time and the lack of outdoor time by utilizing art and nature with children even if it's utilizing nature as materials or subject.

Much of the information found on the benefits of art and nature to children’s motor development was from the fields of play therapy, occupational therapy, and nature/outdoor school programs. Because of this, despite the findings confirming many benefits of art therapy, ecotherapy, and eco-art therapy to children’s motor development, such as the facilitation of the learning process, encouraging play, and the use of tools, materials, and activities that can exercise their muscle to aid in their development, further research to strengthen these findings is recommended. In this research, we also found that cognitive development, social-emotional development, academic achievement, and general well-being were also positively impacted by art and nature, yet these areas were not the focus of the research. Therefore, further research is also recommended to explore potential benefits that art therapy, ecotherapy, and eco-art therapy can have in other areas of child development.

To further strengthen the field of art therapy researchers should explore the relationships of art materials and art activities to the motor development of children. The exploration of possible benefits of art materials and art activities to motor development can also be expanded to other populations such as teens, adults, and the elderly. These explorations can help the field gain more standing within the scientific community as well as help create art therapy treatments that are informed by research.

Further exploration of potential benefits of tools, materials, and activities concerning children’s motor development can also be done in the fields of ecotherapy and eco-art therapy. These investigations in addition to strengthening the fields of ecotherapy and eco-art therapy can also help inform the field of art therapy, especially when it comes to the use of nature whether it be as material, setting, or subject.
