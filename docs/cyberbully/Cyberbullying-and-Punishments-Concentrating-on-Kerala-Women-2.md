## Cyber Harassment Cases in Kerala and Culture
 
Currently, cyber harassment cases are increasing in Kerala. If we look closely into it, we can understand that most cyberbullying is against women. Men who defend the harassed women are also the target of cyberbullies on Social Media. According to the article *Cyber Crimes in Kerala: A Study,* Kerala is in the 6th place when it comes to cyber-crimes in India. They also point out that 5 out of 8 cyber cases are against women in Kerala. According to the State Government of Kerala, most women bullied online are teenagers or young women. Most cyber cases in Kerala are reported in Kochi, the commercial capital of Kerala. 

Women in India are expected to be ideal. Mostly they are categorized below men. This old-fashioned mindset exists in Kerala too. The increasing number of cyber-crimes against women proves it. Kerala's sex ratio (women to men) is the highest in India and the only state where women outnumber men. Compared to other parts of India, women hold a much important household. Still, women are expected to restrict themselves from voicing their thoughts for their benefit. According to the article *Rape victims in Kerala*, rape victims and their families face public humiliation.
