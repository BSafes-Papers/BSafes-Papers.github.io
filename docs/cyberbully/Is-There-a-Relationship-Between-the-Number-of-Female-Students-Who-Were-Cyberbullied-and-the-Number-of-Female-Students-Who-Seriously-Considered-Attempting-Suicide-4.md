## IV. RESULTS
GEE was used to assess the relationship between the number of females who were cyberbullied (i.e., predictor variable) and the number of females who seriously considered suicide (i.e., outcome variable). The findings indicate that there is no relationship between the predictor variable and the outcome variable (p = 0.625). Therefore, the null hypothesis was accepted.
