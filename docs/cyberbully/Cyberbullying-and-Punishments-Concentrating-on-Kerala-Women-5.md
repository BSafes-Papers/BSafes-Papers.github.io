## Bhagyalakshmi and group
On 26th September 2020, around 4 pm, Bhagyalakshmi, a famous Malayalam dubbing artist along with two other activists (Diya Sanaa and Sreelakshmi Arakkal) confronted Vijay P. Nair, a YouTuber for posting abusive videos against women. Bhagyalakshmi and the group, video recorded the whole incident. Arakkal live-streamed it on Facebook. The Youtuber was slapped and poured motor oil. The protesters forced the man to apologize to his bullies. Nair was in his lodge room at Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala. His laptop and other electronic gadgets were taken away by the women. These were later submitted to the police by the women themselves for proof against Vijay P. Nair in Thampanoor police station.

Nair who claims to have a doctorate in clinical psychology identifies himself as an author on his youtube channel and made derogatory comments against women for months.

Bhagyalakshmi also filed a complaint against Santhivila Dinesh (an Indian Film Director). He also, just like Nair, abused women online especially on his youtube channels *Lights Camera Action* and *Talks-Let Me Talk*. Dinesh and Nair abused not only women but also older film personalities. Ahead of this confrontation, multiple police complaints were lodged against Dinesh and Nair across Kerala. But due to the lack of strong laws, no action was taken against the accused. Right after the incident Bhagyalakshmi and the group did not back off from answering the media’s questions. Their immediate response was covered live by famous Malayalam news channels. According to Manorama News, Bhagyalakshmi said that they resorted to the protest as the police did not act on their complaint. She also said they were fed up with the insult they had been facing. The group of women also said that they are ready to face any consequence from the law that once failed to protect them. According to Manorama News, the protesters had filed a complaint against Vijay P. Nair and Santhivila Dinesh, with the State Women's Commission, Cyber Cell, Women and Child Development department, and State Gender Advisor. The point to be noticed is that the women did not try to hide what they did, they even went streamed live the confrontation on Facebook. They called their act a protest against cyberbullies and laws. Bhagyalakshi and the group received both support and criticism from Kerala society. Charges were pressed against Bhagyalskmi by Vijay P. Nair for assaulting him.
