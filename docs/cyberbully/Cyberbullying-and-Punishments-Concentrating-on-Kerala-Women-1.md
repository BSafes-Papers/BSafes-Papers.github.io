## Kerala a South Indian State
Kerala is a south Indian state, where the literacy rate is 100%. Kerala also has the highest Human Development Index rate in India. In Kerala, from past years, women who are open about their opinion are the easy targets of cyberbullies. Death threats, rape threats, and body shaming are often used by bullies. Even though cyber harassing cases are increasing, there are no laws that are helping women. I am trying to analyze the ethics of some of the punishments given to cyberbullies by the Kerala society and what makes Keralite women easy targets of cyberbullies. Even after being one of the highly developed states in India, why is this happening in Kerala?
