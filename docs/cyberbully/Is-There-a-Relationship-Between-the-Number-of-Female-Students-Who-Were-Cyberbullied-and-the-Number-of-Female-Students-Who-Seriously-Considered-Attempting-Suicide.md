## ABSTRACT
In the United States, cyberbullying has become a major public health concern. Indeed, many people who are victims of cyberbullying consider harming themselves. Because criminal justice practitioners are concerned with public safety, this is an area worthy of study. The general purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the percentage of female students who were electronically bullied and the percentage of female students who seriously considered suicide. Data were collected in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 using a threestage cluster sample design, which produced a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9–12 who attended public and private schools. As an alternative to avoid the distributional assumptions of independent observations, this study used generalized estimating equations (GEE). The findings revealed that there was no significant difference between the percentage of female students who were electronically bullied and the percentage of female students who seriously considered suicide.
