## I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DATA BREACH LITIGATION

The effects of identity theft can haunt data breach victims for years.<sup>2</sup> Some victims report the need to constantly shut down fraudulent accounts. <sup>3</sup> Likewise, some report countless fraudulent inquiries on their credit reports. <sup>4</sup> Some victims even report fraudulent tax returns filed in their names. <sup>5</sup> Many consumers believe there is not much they can do to protect their data in the first place. <sup>6</sup>

In recent years, data breach occurrences have increased dramatically. <sup>7</sup> Estimates show around 2.5 billion consumers were impacted by a data breach in 2018.<sup>8</sup> The increasing use of technology and constantly improving skills of hackers has contributed to the prevalence of recent data breaches.<sup>9</sup> Additionally, data breaches can compromise a wide variety of private information. <sup>10</sup> The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center reported that cybercrime caused “$2.7 billion in financial losses in 2018.” <sup>11</sup> This marked increase in cyberattacks resulted in more data breach litigation.<sup>12</sup>

One challenge victims of data breaches face when seeking legal relief is satisfying the Article III standing requirements.<sup>13</sup> Meeting Article III standing requirements is crucial for plaintiffs in data breach cases because many plaintiffs bring these claims as class actions, which are often brought in federal court.<sup>14</sup> Additionally, when plaintiffs sue in state court, the defendants often remove the action to federal court.<sup>15</sup> The Supreme Court’s decision in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins<sup>16</sup> has led to an increase in courts recognizing injury in data breach cases. <sup>17</sup>These holdings allow more victims of data breaches to meet standing requirements and bring claims against the organizations responsible for protecting their data.<sup>18</sup>  A circuit split nevertheless exists, and some circuits refuse to recognize the risk of future identity theft as an Article III injury. <sup>19</sup> The split centers around whether the plaintiff can show injury simply by alleging that a breach puts them at increased risk of fraud. <sup>20</sup>  According to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia’s holding *in In re U.S. Office of Personnel Management Data Security Breach Litigation (In re OPM Litigation),*  <sup>21</sup>circuits continue to find standing where plaintiffs merely allege an increased risk of future fraud.<sup>22</sup>  The Supreme Court has not yet addressed this issue, leaving one’s right to bring data breach claims based on the risk of future identity theft dependent upon jurisdiction.<sup>23</sup>

This Note argues the District of Columbia Circuit’s decision in *In re OPM Litigation* is consistent with the Supreme Court’s interpretation of Article III standing requirements and the Court’s precedent because an increased risk of identity theft is a sufficient injury to confer standing.<sup>24</sup> Finding standing in cases involving data breaches is necessary to hold companies accountable for their role in data breaches. <sup>25</sup> Further, a statutory solution will not be sufficient to remedy data breach plaintiffs’ barrier to courts.<sup>26</sup> Part II discusses Article III standing and the current circuit split over in data breach cases. Part III sets forth the facts of In re *OPM Litigation*. Part IV explains the reasoning for the District of Columbia Circuit’s decision. Part V argues that it is consistent with Supreme Court precedent, that such a holding is necessary to incentivize companies to improve practices, and that a statutory solution will not be enough to confer standing. Finally, Part VI explores this decision’s impact on data breach litigation.

## II. THE BACKGROUND OF DATA BREACH LITIGATION

Data breaches occur at a high rate in part because of the frequent use of electronic storage methods to maintain data.<sup>27</sup> In 2018 alone, data breaches impacted billions of people.<sup>28</sup> Unsurprisingly, the number of lawsuits brought by victims of such breaches is also increasing, leading to constant development in data breach litigation. <sup>29</sup>  Data breach litigation, however, is often restricted by the Article III standing doctrine.<sup>30</sup> The Supreme Court has not yet resolved the inconsistency among circuits.<sup>31</sup>

### A. *The Impact of Data Breaches*
Data breaches have become common because of the increase in electronic information storage.<sup>32</sup> Hackers have an easier time accessing electronically stored information, increasing the risk consumers face. <sup>33</sup> Estimates show that data breaches impact a high percentage of major organizations.<sup>34</sup>

The type of information stolen typically informs the nature of the harm to the consumer. <sup>35</sup>  Harms may range from needing to cancel a credit card to having one’s credit history ruined. <sup>36</sup> These variable harms are often what victims bring to litigation. <sup>37</sup> Regardless of the precise harm, consumers primarily feel the negative effects of poor data management practices. <sup>38</sup>

The lack of federal laws governing the duties of organizations that store sensitive data makes obtaining a legal remedy difficult.<sup>39</sup> Rather than being guided by a comprehensive framework, liability in data breaches is covered by a “patchwork of laws” that often address specific issues and not data breach litigation as a whole.<sup>40</sup> Under state and federal laws, liability is not imposed automatically when a breach occurs.v<sup>41</sup> Rather, plaintiffs must satisfy certain requirements for the organization to be held liable.<sup>42</sup>

### B. *The Interpretation of Article III Standing Requirements*

The Constitution states that only “cases” and “controversies” may be heard in federal court. <sup>43</sup> However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the “cases” and “controversies” language to mean that only plaintiffs who have standing may be heard in federal court.<sup>44</sup> Article III therefore restricts federal court jurisdiction to “cases” and “controversies.” <sup>45</sup> To satisfy Article III standing, the Supreme Court requires plaintiffs to show they suffered an injury.<sup>46</sup> Federal courts must dismiss the case and cannot consider the merits of a plaintiff’s claim where there is no injury sufficient for standing. <sup>47</sup>

The standing requirement is grounded in the constitutional principles that advisory opinions are forbidden and the federal courts should not exceed their constitutional limits.<sup>48</sup> Besides limiting the role of federal courts, the standing requirement serves other purposes.<sup>49</sup>  First, the doctrine guarantees that a decision will primarily impact plaintiffs, therefore preventing claims that may be brought by “concerned bystanders.”<sup>50</sup> In addition, the doctrine minimizes the litigation of “abstract injuries such as violations of generalized rights . . . .” <sup>51</sup> Injury in fact is the element of standing most often at issue in data breach cases.<sup>52</sup>

Plaintiffs in data breach cases often struggle to show Article III standing requirements under Supreme Court jurisprudence.<sup>53</sup> To satisfy Article III standing, plaintiffs must allege an injury that is “concrete and particularized[,] and . . . actualand imminent.”<sup>54</sup> In data breach cases, plaintiffs often struggle to show injury— especially when their information has yet to be misappropriated.<sup>55</sup> The Supreme Court has not decided the issue of Article III standing in data breach cases, but it has analyzed other future injuries that are applicable to data breach litigation.<sup>56</sup>

First, the Court has recognized that future injuries must be “actual or imminent” to satisfy the injury requirement for standing.<sup>57</sup> In 2013, the Supreme Court decided C*lapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA* <sup>58</sup> and held an “objectively reasonable likelihood” of future injury could not meet the elements of standing.<sup>59</sup> In *Clapper*, the plaintiffs asserted two theories of injury, mirroring the arguments often made by plaintiffs in data breach cases.<sup>60</sup> In rejecting the plaintiffs’ theories, the Court reasoned that any risk of future injury must be “certainly impending” to be sufficient for injury in fact.<sup>61</sup>  Practitioners and courts view this holding as inhibiting plaintiffs’ability to meet standing requirements.<sup>62</sup>

Later, the Court held in *Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins*  <sup>63</sup>that a risk of future injury may satisfy the “concreteness” requirement of standing.<sup>64</sup> Similar to the injury raised in many data breach cases, the plaintiff in Spokeo alleged they suffered an intangible injury as opposed to tangible.<sup>65</sup>  In assessing whether the injury was sufficiently concrete, the Court noted that the injury must be “real” rather than “abstract,” and intangible harm must be considered in light of “both history and the judgment of Congress.” <sup>66</sup>  The Court also noted that a procedural violation of a statute alone is insufficient to show concrete injury.<sup>67</sup>  In discussing the risk of future injury, the Court recognized the risk of real harm can sometimes satisfy the concreteness requirement where the plaintiff can allege that Congress intended to remedy their particular harm.<sup>68</sup>Despite these recent holdings, circuit courts remain split on the issue facing data breach plaintiffs, leaving victims with inconsistent remedies across circuits.<sup>69</sup>

### C. *Circuit Courts’ Examination of Article III Standing in Data Breach Cases*

The circuit courts remain split over whether the increased risk of future identity theft is sufficient to show injury required for standing.<sup>70</sup> While a number of courts have allowed such cases to proceed, some still refuse to expand the scope of Article III standing to allow them to be heard.<sup>71</sup> While the D.C., Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth circuits have allowed these claims to move forward with an alleged risk of future injury, the Second, Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits have not.<sup>72</sup> A number of circuit courts have found standing where plaintiffs allege an increased risk of identity theft. In *Attias v. CareFirst, Inc.*, <sup>73</sup> the court held the plaintiff established injury because information had already been compromised and there was no longer a hypothetical risk of injury.<sup>74</sup> In *Krottner v. Starbucks Corp.,* <sup>75</sup>the Ninth Circuit found that stolen, unencrypted person information stored on a laptop created an increased risk of identity theft.<sup>76</sup>The court asserted that this risk was credible. <sup>77</sup>

Similarly, in *Lewert v. P.F.

In contrast, some circuits do not recognize such injuries as sufficient to constitute standing.<sup>85</sup> In *Beck v. McDonald*, <sup>86</sup> the Fourth Circuit held that there was no injury where plaintiffs could not show that information contained on a stolen laptop was misused, or that the thief intended to misuse the information.<sup>87</sup> Likewise, in *Reilly v. Ceridian Corp*., <sup>88</sup> the Third Circuit found that where allegations of a future injury required speculation, injury was not sufficiently imminent for the purposes of standing.<sup>89</sup>

Moreover, the Eight Circuit in* In re SuperValu, Inc.* <sup>90</sup>declined to recognize injury where plaintiffs’ information was compromised but no misuse occurred.<sup>91</sup> Similarly, the Second Circuit refused to find injury in *Whalen v. Michaels Stores, Inc.* <sup>92</sup>when plaintiff could not show they incurred losses, even where attempted identity theft occurred.<sup>93</sup> As a result, the holdings of district courts are similarly split, leaving plaintiffs’ abilities to bring their claims dependent on where they are located.<sup>94</sup>

## III. THE FACTS OF *IN RE U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT DATA SECURITY BREACH LITIGATION*

The District of Columbia Circuit examined the standing issue in data breach cases in *In re OPM Litigation.* <sup>95</sup> The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is the main human resource agency of the federal government.<sup>96</sup>  The OPM electronically stores personal information on federal employees as well as millions of individuals who submitted to federal background checks.<sup>97</sup> In 2014, OPM experienced multiple cyberattacks that compromised the private information of nearly 21.5 million people.<sup>98</sup>  The stolen information from the breach included “current and prospective employees’ Social Security numbers, birth dates, and residency details, along with approximately 5.6 million sets of fingerprints.”
<sup>99</sup>  The breach also compromised personal information about employees’ relatives.<sup>100</sup>

Affected individuals have since experienced varying types of financial fraud, and many as-of-yet unaffected individuals fear future identity theft.<sup>101</sup> OPM offered some individuals free fraud monitoring, identity theft protection, and insurance for a period of time.<sup>102</sup> Many people filed lawsuits against OPM and Keypoint, an investigation and security partner that handled many background checks for the federal government, after these measures did not rectify their fears.<sup>103</sup>

Some plaintiffs alleged OPM had notice that its systems were “prime targets”for cyberattacks, and that KeyPoint failed to meet industry standards in maintaining OPM’s information security defenses.<sup>104</sup> Plaintiffs further alleged hackers specifically targeted personal information for theft, noting that some plaintiffs had already experienced malicious use of their personal information.<sup>105</sup> OPM and KeyPoint moved to dismiss the claims on Article III standing grounds.<sup>106</sup> The district court declined to recognize an increased risk of future identity theft as sufficient to show standing and granted defendants’ motion to dismiss. <sup>107</sup> On appeal, the District of Columbia Circuit held that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged injury in fact as required for Article III standing.<sup>108</sup>

## IV. A NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF *IN RE U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT DATA SECURITY BREACH LITIGATION*

In In re *OPM Litigation*, the D.C. Circuit assessed whether plaintiffs whose personal information was compromised but not yet used fraudulently had sufficient injury for Article III standing.<sup>109</sup>  While plaintiffs alleged numerous harms, the court focused on their increased risk of future identity theft, as all plaintiffs alleged that harm.<sup>110</sup> The court began by identifying recent Supreme Court standing precedent.<sup>111</sup> It then examined the plaintiffs’ claims in light of its prior holding in Attias, where it found that plaintiffs’ substantial risk of future identity theft satisfied standing.<sup>112</sup>  Finally, the court rejected OPM’s argument that government breaches are motivated by interests other than fraud and distinguished the present case’s facts from those OPM cited.<sup>113</sup>

### A. *The Court Assesses Supreme Court and Circuit Precedent*

The D.C. Circuit examined recent Supreme Court holdings to support its conclusion that plaintiffs’ increased risk of future identity theft satisfies Article III standing’s injury requirement.<sup>114</sup> The court first noted that in *Spokeo,* Inc., the Supreme Court held that injury must be “concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” <sup>115</sup> The court also pointed out that the Supreme Court had previously held claims of future injury must be “certainly impending” or indicate a “substantial risk” of an injury occurring.<sup>116</sup>  The court next examined the plaintiffs’ argument that the district court’s opinion was contrary to the circuit’s holding in *Attias*. <sup>117</sup>  It found that although the attacks were distinguishable from those in *Attias* in some ways, the OPM hackers still possessed all the information they needed for fraud like the hackers in *Attias.* <sup>118</sup>  Further, some plaintiffs in the present case had already experienced misappropriation, which illustrated the malicious intent of the hackers.<sup>119</sup>  The court found that these facts were similar to those in *Attias* and sufficiently showed that the plaintiffs’ risk of future identity theft was substantial, rather than “merely speculative or theoretical.” <sup>120</sup>

### B. *The Court Rejects OPM’s Arguments of Hacker Motivation and Distinguishes Prior Caselaw*

The court next examined OPM’s arguments: (1) unique hacker motivation for government systems cases, and (2) plaintiffs’ lack of standing.<sup>121</sup>  The D.C. Circuit ultimately rejected both theories.<sup>122</sup>  The court first rejected the arguments that the factors motivating hackers to breach a government system are different than those motivating hackers to breach other systems, noting that while there may be other motives for one to hack a government system, it is equally possible that the purpose is to steal identities.<sup>123</sup>  The court emphasized that the possibility of other motives does not negate the opportunity for identity theft.<sup>124</sup>

Next, the court found that OPM’s cited cases, which held that the plaintiffs did not have injury sufficient for standing when they alleged a future risk of identity theft, were distinguishable from the present case.<sup>125</sup>  First, the court distinguished *Beck*, where stealing a laptop containing personal information compromised data because there was no evidence of misuse or intent to misuse the data, and the risk of future harm remained speculative.<sup>126</sup>Similarly, the court distinguished Reilly, where a hacker “potentially” accessed “personal and financial information” but future harm was speculative because plaintiffs showed no evidence of misuse.<sup>127</sup>  In contrast to *Beck and Reilly*, the court noted that plaintiffs in this case alleged that hackers targeted their personal information specifically for identity fraud purposes, and used it for that purpose in some cases.<sup>128</sup> Therefore, the substantial risk of future identity theft sufficed to show injury. <sup>129</sup>

## V. A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF *IN RE U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT DATA SECURITY BREACH LITIGATION*
Data breach victims should have injury sufficient for standing where they can allege an increased risk of future identity theft when their information is compromised. The increased risk of future identity theft is not speculative, is sufficiently concrete under Supreme Court jurisprudence, and finding standing allows entities to be held accountable for their role in data breaches, thereby incentivizing better protection.<sup>130</sup>  Further, a statutory solution or private right of action likely will not allow data breach plaintiffs to pursue the merits of their claims or a remedy because they would still need to show injury sufficient for Article III standing.<sup>131</sup>

### A. *An Increased Risk of Future Identity Theft is Concrete Injury under Supreme Court Precedent*
Satisfying the standing elements, including injury, should be a “low threshold” and should not keep data breach victims out of court. <sup>132</sup>  Even if a narrow approach is taken following *Clapper* and *Spokeo*, Inc., allegations of a future risk of identity theft warrant a finding that the elements have been properly established.<sup>133</sup> In cases where plaintiffs can allege a high risk of future identify theft, such as *In re OPM Litigation,* an attenuated chain of future events does not exist and therefore does not raise the issues the Supreme Court was concerned with in *Clapper*. <sup>134</sup>

Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 422 (2013) (finding no standing where plaintiffs allege risk of future injury because chain of inferences leading to injury was too speculative and depended on many unknown events).
{: .fs-2}
***

Plaintiffs in data breach cases may allege injury sufficient for standing based on their “substantial risk of future identity theft” and associated expenses necessary to reduce their risk. <sup>135</sup>  This finding is compatible with *Clapper* because many plaintiffs will have already experienced attempted or actual fraudulent activity, which gives rise to the inference that victims who have not been impacted yet are likely to be in the future.136  Importantly, this inference eliminates the possibility that a hypothetical chain of future events is required for injury to occur.<sup>137</sup>

Further, plaintiffs in data breach cases can at times raise “concrete” injuries such as those the Court was concerned with in *Spokeo, Inc*., where plaintiffs raised instances of attempted fraud and losses of large amounts of financial information.<sup>138</sup> Data breach victims may raise a “risk of real harm” by alleging that they are at an increased risk to have their data stolen in the future.<sup>139</sup>  Although risk of harm is an “intangible” injury, the Court in *Spokeo, Inc*. specified that, when it held an injury must be “concrete,” it did not intend to require them to be “tangible.” <sup>140</sup>  For example, data breach plaintiffs may allege specific instances of misuse that have already occurred.<sup>141</sup> Unlike the plaintiffs in *Spokeo, Inc.*, this fact helps plaintiffs with data breach claims to illustrate their *risk* of real harm is substantial.<sup>142</sup>

In data breach cases such as In re *OPM Litigation*, the risk at issue is one that Congress intended to remedy.<sup>143</sup>  In recent years, Congress has shown that it intends organizations to be held accountable for their roles in data breaches, as evidenced by the representatives’ comments proposed legislation.<sup>144</sup>  Therefore, the findings of the D.C. Circuit further align with the Supreme Court’s holding in *Spokeo, Inc*. because the court recognizes data breach victims’ risk of real harm as one Congress intends to remedy.<sup>145</sup>  While there is no comprehensive framework for finding liability in data breach cases, there are statutes and regulations that apply to certain facets of data breach issues.<sup>146</sup>  This illustrates Congress’s intent to provide some remedies to those impacted by breaches.<sup>147</sup>

### B. *Plaintiffs’ Claims Must be Recognized to Hold Companies Accountable for Data Breaches*

If a federal court finds that the plaintiff does not have standing, it must dismiss the case immediately.<sup>148</sup>  As a result, the court will not hear the merits of the claim.<sup>149</sup> This means the legal issue that the plaintiff alleges will not be decided.<sup>150</sup> Under the ruling from *In re OPM Litigation*, an organization that was subject to a data breach may be held liable and plaintiffs’ claim may be assessed on the merits.<sup>151</sup>  Plaintiffs sought redress due to a failure to conform to industry standards and failure to adequately protect security credentials.<sup>152</sup>The court found the plaintiffs had sufficient standing and, as a result, the case was remanded to be heard on its merits and potentially hold the OPM accountable. <sup>153</sup>

Organizations and companies are far less likely to be held accountable for their roles in data breaches if lawsuits where an increased risk of future identity theft is the only injury alleged are dismissed before court reaches the merits.<sup>154</sup> Plaintiffs in data breach cases bring claims under a variety of theories, including “‘negligence, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, unfair and deceptive business practices, invasion of privacy,’ and violations of various state and federal statutes.” <sup>155</sup>Under these theories, entities can at times be held liable for their role in a data breach.<sup>156</sup>

However, accountability under these theories can be imposed only if plaintiffs can surmount Article III standing requirements.<sup>157</sup> Federal courts should recognize the increased risk of future identity theft as injury sufficient to satisfy the standing elements so there will be far more opportunities to examine organizations’ security practices.<sup>158</sup> If courts fail to recognize standing in these situations, the risk stemming from the data breach primarily impacts consumers rather than the companies obligated to protect their data.<sup>159</sup> The holding of *In re OPM Litigation* continues to move the analysis in the right direction because it recognizes the range of injuries plaintiffs often face and allows courts to examine the merits of their claims.<sup>160</sup>  This holding is necessary, because movement in this direction can increase the risk of liability that entities face and incentivize them to better protect and manage personal information.<sup>161</sup>

### C. *Statutory Standing and Private Causes of Action Are Unlikely to Allow Plaintiffs to Reach the Merits of their Claims*
Conferring statutory standing is unlikely to provide plaintiffs with a way to hold companies accountable. Article III requirements are a “hard floor” and Congress may not circumvent them entirely. <sup>162</sup>  The fact that a statute describes a right will not allow a plaintiff to sue in the absence of injury. <sup>163</sup>  The Supreme Court has recognized that standing requirements bind both Congress and federal courts. <sup>164</sup> Congressional legislation may authorize litigation by conferring standing within Article III’s confines. <sup>165</sup>  Nevertheless, litigants are required to show “a distinct and palpable injury to [themselves]” that the court can remedy. <sup>166</sup>  Congress may not direct federal courts to hear cases where Article III standing is not met.<sup>167</sup>

Further, state data breach laws have not consistently conferred standing where plaintiffs could not meet Article III injury requirements.<sup>168</sup> Even where there is a state data breach statute theoretically creating a cause of action, plaintiffs yield inconsistent results in establishing standing.<sup>169</sup> This inconsistency emphasizes the need for courts to recognize a risk of future identity theft as sufficient injury satisfy standing requirements. <sup>170</sup>

Federal district courts in California have declined to confer standing—even where procedural violations of statutes were alleged—because plaintiffs did not establish that defendant’s violation of consumer protection statutes caused injury. <sup>171</sup> Similarly, federal district courts in Maryland have found a lack of standing in claims brought under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act and District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act because plaintiffs did not allege sufficient injury—even in light of a statutory violation.<sup>172</sup> Further, federal district courts in Ohio have failed to confer standing on plaintiffs alleging violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act because they did not allege an injury other than a statutory violation.<sup>173</sup>The dispositive issue in establishing standing in data breach cases is whether the court will recognize plaintiffs’ increased risk of future theft as a sufficiently imminent injury under Article III, and not whether a statute confers standing in its text.<sup>174</sup>  Therefore, a statutory cause of action alone will not confer standing on plaintiffs in the absence of Article III injury, leaving plaintiffs unable to hold the companies who are responsible for maintaining their sensitive data accountable.<sup>175</sup>

Further, the Supreme Court in *Spokeo, Inc.* held that a statute could not confer Article III standing without a cognizable injury even where there was a technical statutory violation.<sup>176</sup>  The Court rejected the contention that a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act conferred standing where information, the veracity of which was protected by the Act, was reported incorrectly because of a procedural violation.<sup>177</sup>  The Court reiterated that concrete injury is required by Article III and a statutory violation alone is not enough. <sup>178</sup>  Therefore, plaintiffs may not “allege a bare procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm, and satisfy the injuryin-fact requirement of Article III.” <sup>179</sup>  However, the Court acknowledged that a risk of real harm may still satisfy the concreteness requirement for injury.<sup>180</sup>

The Court noted that the circuit court below did not adequately examine whether an Article III injury resulted from the procedural violation. <sup>181</sup>  This shows that a plaintiff’s ability to sue depends on whether the plaintiff can allege sufficient injury even where there may be a procedural violation of a statute. Therefore, courts should recognize an increased risk of identity theft as sufficient risk to show injury in data breach cases because in many courts, a statutory violation alone leaves plaintiffs unable to reach the merits of their claims against companies responsible for the safekeeping of personal information.<sup>182</sup>

VI. THE LASTING IMPACT OF* IN RE U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT DATA SECURITY BREACH LITIGATION*
The FBI reports as many as 900 complaints of cybercrime each day.<sup>183</sup>  Data breaches continue to impact billions of individuals each year and cost millions to rectify. <sup>184</sup>  Moreover, data breaches are extremely expensive. <sup>185</sup>  These costs include identity theft and tax fraud. <sup>186</sup> As a result of a data breach, victims often can be negatively impacted for years, or even decades.<sup>187</sup> Crucially, there are many instances where a victim of identity theft will not know of the damage they have suffered until a loan or credit card application is denied years later. <sup>188</sup>

Currently, the District of Columbia Circuit is one among only a handful of circuits willing to grant standing where the injury alleged is based on the increased risk of future identity theft.<sup>189</sup>  Plaintiffs who had their personal information compromised in a data breach and face an increased risk of identity theft may only bring their claims in some areas of the country.<sup>190</sup>  The District of Columbia Circuit’s opinion, however, supports a necessary step in the way courts treat injury in fact in data breach litigation.<sup>191</sup>  In re *OPM Litigation* recognized that courts can interpret the standing doctrine to recognize injuries faced by data breach victims while comporting with Supreme Court precedent.<sup>192</sup> If other courts do not adopt this approach, government and organizational security practices are less likely to change because they have less incentive to better protect against breaches.<sup>193</sup>

Ceridian Corp., 664 F.3d 38, 42 (3d Cir. 2011) (finding any alleged future injury was speculative, and therefore insufficient for Article III standing); see also Marcum, *supra* note 149, at 554 (explaining standing analysis’s conflicting interpretations of injury in fact lead to unpredictable data breach litigation results).

Further, it is unlikely that allowing data breach plaintiffs alleging a risk of future harm to proceed will produce an influx of litigation if courts adhere to *Spokeo Inc.’*s guidance and limit standing to those who can show a concrete risk of harm. See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1549 (2016). For a further discussion of concrete injury for standing purposes, *see supra* Section V.A.
