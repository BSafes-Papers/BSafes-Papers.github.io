## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I would like to thank my family for always being there for me. I especially thank my parents for raising their two boys on great values of maintaining integrity in our relationships and work, self-respect, and respect for others, as well as instilling into us a sense of servant leadership. My father, Nicolas, and my mother, Margaret, have always been and still are an exemplary couple in teaching us family values and finding joy in helping others around us. My parents have always taught us not to be afraid to aim for the stars, work hard, and be humble. A big thank you to my brother Ziad for always being a rock I can lean on during tough times.

The journey to get this far through my studies has not been easy. When I first moved to the United States in December 2000, I had a couple of hundred dollars that my father managed to put aside for me; times were tough. He always taught me to be the best I can be in everything I do. My goal was to seek knowledge and get a terminal degree. Here I am, 20 years later, making my dream come true. I always dreamt of being an astronaut; little did I know that being an astronaut was all about breaking barriers and reaching new heights in life.

I want to also thank my DBA cohort members for being a great support channel throughout this program. Thank you to my dissertation chairs and committee: Dr. Jung Chul Park, Dr. Loran Jarrett, Dr. Joann Quinn, and Dr. Paul Solomon. I also thank my dissertation team and cohort members, Mark Mattia, Michael Summers, and Brad Puckey, for listening to my progress updates for almost a year. A special thank you to Dr. Vernetta Williams for being a fantastic dissertation process guide and writing coach, particularly for keeping me motivated and focused. Congratulations to the Doctor of Business Administration class of 2020; this year has not been easy, but we made it through. Best of luck in all your future endeavors.

## ABSTRACT

Cybersecurity threats and compromises have been at the epicenter of media attention; their risk and effect on people’s digital identity is something not to be taken lightly. Though cyber threats have affected a great number of people in all age groups, this study focuses on 55 to 75-year-olds, as this age group is close to retirement or already retired. Therefore, a notable compromise impacting their digital identity can have a major impact on their life.

To help guide this study, the following research question was formulated, “What are the risk perceptions of individuals, between the ages of 55 and 75 with no IT background, pertaining to their digital identity?” The literature review helped identify seven themes that served as a base to generate a series of qualitative interview questions. Twenty interviews were conducted, transcribed, and coded following the Adapted Thematic Analysis framework, which resulted in four themes that answered the research question.

The themes relevant to the research question were: People accept the risk when it affects their convenience, people are concerned that companies are not being transparent with regards to being good custodians of their digital identity, people are aware of the availability of tools and training to help manage the risks, people want more transparency and control over their digital identity to help ease their concerns of the risks.

The findings from the literature review and the interviews led to a series of interpretations that validated the gaps found in the literature review. Notably, the quarantine caused by the unexpected event (i.e.: COVID-19 pandemic) forced people to an all-time high adoption of the internet. People were aware of the risks pertaining to their digital identity, but their level of awareness varied. This gap developed the need for a personal risk assessment framework and the need for a benchmark of user-friendly best practices to help mitigate the risks. The increased adoption of new technologies similar to machine learning, artificial intelligence, and distributed ledger technologies like blockchain will help in creating more of a transparent ecosystem to interact online as well as reduce human intervention in reacting to and mitigating cybersecurity risks affecting digital identity.
