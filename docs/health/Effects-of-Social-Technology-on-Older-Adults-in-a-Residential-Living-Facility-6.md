## Conclusion

Despite a small sample size and limited duration, key findings are consistent with its application in combating loneliness and social isolation and providing comfort for older adults. For the majority of participants, social technology in the form of Sherish℠ Connect had a positive impact on older adults’ self-report of loneliness and social isolation within a residential living facility. All participants did report feeling comforted by Sherish℠ Connect at least occasionally, with the majority of participants reporting often or always being comforted by the technology. Researchers hope this study provides baseline research that inspires additional studies investigating Sherish℠ Connect to occur, as this social technology has a great potential for a positive impact on the older adult population. During the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, social technology, as well as occupational therapy as a whole, is becoming critical in combating social isolation. The utilization of social technology, such as Sherish℠ Connect, is valuable to intervention as it supports social participation in a non-traditional way that allows older adults to connect with individuals that are not geographically close. Many older adults are currently in quarantine and, if living in a residential living facility, are not allowed visitors. Social technology has the opportunity to make colossal advancements in healthcare, via telehealth, and social participation from the safety of quarantine.
