## Results
The study began with 10 participants, and due to discontinued use of Sherish℠ Connect, unforeseen health issues, and fatality, the final study contained seven participants, yielding an attrition rate of 30%. The resulting participant ages ranged from 73-101 with a mean age of 89.

Participant pre- and post-test scores on the *PHQ-9* showed no depressive signs for six participants, while one participant demonstrated increased depressive signs with a post-test score of 9, indicating mild depression. Three participants received pre-test scores indicating a severe cognitive impairment according to the *BIMS*. Two participants remained the same with one improving to the moderate cognitive impairment level. There was slight improvement with one client whose pretest score was at the moderate cognitive impairment level. Four participants’ pre-test scores placed them at little to no cognitive impairment level. Of these, one improved, one remained the same, and two deteriorated. Of those that deteriorated, only one participant’s post-test score placed them in the moderate cognitive decline level. When comparing pre- and post-test scores, three participants’ scores improved, two remained the same, and two had cognitive levels that declined. Data was insufficient to report on the impact of medication changes as a result of using Sherish℠ Connect. Results from the interviews demonstrated various common findings among participants’ responses. Below are tables displaying the results of the data collection and interviews of participants. 

Table 1 exhibits data collected from medical records review (see Appendix B).

Table 2 exhibits participant responses from the 15 interview questions (see Appendix C).
