## Discussion
Findings were consistent with published research from Drageset et al. (2011), who found that emotional connection to loved ones was a component of decreasing loneliness as results from this study showed that 57.1% of participants used Sherish℠ Connect to engage with family members. This finding suggests that Sherish℠ Connect could aid in decreasing loneliness and social isolation, though it is likely one of many possible components. Hasan and Linger (2016) found that enjoyment and connection were outcomes of social technology use, which aligns with results from the current study. Social connectedness was another target outcome of the current study; similarly, Chen and Schulz (2016) found that social technology fosters feelings of social connectivity.

During this study, three out of 10 participants

dropped out, which brought the final number of participants to seven. Two of the dropouts were due to fatality and health issues, and the last was excluded due to lack of use of Sherish℠ Connect. Various survey responses may have been skewed due to dementia and memory related diagnoses. Due to the inconsistency of participants' pre and post *BIMS* and *PHQ-9* scores, results were ultimately inconclusive if Sherish℠ Connect has a direct effect on mental status and depression. Researchers noted the increased relevance of the need for social technology in residential living facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic began soon after completion of the on-site participant surveys, and residents were promptly prohibited from receiving visitors. Social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to increased feelings of social isolation. The COVID-19 pandemic brought to light the need for occupational therapy intervention, specifically through the use of social technology, to combat loneliness and isolation. Social technology is a practical and cost-effective solution that can effortlessly be embedded into occupational therapy intervention and activitybased therapy. It is within the scope of occupational therapy to incorporate social participation and engagement into the everyday lives of individuals of all ages. The results of this study offer the potential for further research and implementation of social technology within residential living facilities.

### Limitations
There are a few limitations of the study that may have impacted the results. One limitation was the inclusion criteria, which prevented users of Sherish℠ Connect outside of the Midwest residential living facility from participating in the study. Another limitation found was excluding residents of the facility who have limited family support systems and cannot successfully use Sherish℠ Connect, resulting in a small sample size. Additionally, cognitive impairments of some of the participants resulted in overall confusion about the Sherish℠ Connect and use, which could have possibly skewed or impacted responses. Researchers were surprised to discover that numerous participants did not remember they had Sherish℠ Connect or reported they could not remember how to use the technology, despite receiving training from staff. The listed limitations could have a potential impact on the users’ perceptions of Sherish℠ Connect.

### Recommendations
Future research studies would benefit from modifying the inclusion criteria to include a more extensive selection of individuals to participate. Investigating external variables affecting components being studied apart from Sherish℠ Connect would also be beneficial. Future researchers might benefit from removing the direct assessment of participants’ memory of Sherish℠ Connect and focusing on quantifiable aspects that could be assessed, even in the presence of cognitive impairment. Conducting the study for an entire year may provide more comprehensive data involving potential seasonal effects on the studied components. Researching multiple facilities to include a broader population among different geographical regions would also be a valuable element to include for future research. Future researchers should also further investigate the impact of diagnoses on the utilization and benefits of Sherish℠ Connect. Additionally, utilizing more sensitive instruments, such as the Beck Depression Inventory II and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, to assess participants’ cognition and depressive symptoms would increase validity, as the instruments currently being used demonstrate decreased sensitivity.

Despite the limitations, the results of the study may have applications in the evaluation and usage of such technologies within residential living facilities. Caregivers, family members, and potential healthcare providers may utilize this technology to reach the older adult population during mandated times of social distancing. This technology is an ideal option in times of national emergency. Without this form of technology, social distancing may result in isolation for many.
