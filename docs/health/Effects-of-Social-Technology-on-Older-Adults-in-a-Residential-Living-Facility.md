## Abstract
***Introduction:** Loneliness and social isolation impact physical and mental health negatively for older adults. Researchers noted an increased relevance of the need for social technology with the emergence of COVID-19. The objective was to investigate the impact of social technology on older adults’ levels of loneliness and social isolation within a residential living facility.*

***Methods:** Descriptive, multiple baseline; occurred over four months with quarterly intervals of data collection. Seven participants met inclusion criteria and were included in the convenience sample. Participants used Sherish℠ Connect for a minimum of one month. Sherish℠ Connect is a televisionbased social technology platform. Data was collected via survey responses and medical records review to determine the effect of the Sherish℠ Connect on perceived loneliness.*

***Results:** Seven older adults (ages 73-101, 3 males, 4 females) were included. Six participants reported using the Sherish℠ Connect weekly or daily. The majority of participants reported this form of social technology provided comfort.*

***Discussion:** Sherish℠ Connect has potential to combat loneliness and social isolation. Researchers hope this study provides baseline research that inspires additional studies investigating Sherish℠ Connect. Social technology adds value to occupational therapy intervention for social participation. Sherish℠ Connect has the capability to increase social participation among older adults.*
