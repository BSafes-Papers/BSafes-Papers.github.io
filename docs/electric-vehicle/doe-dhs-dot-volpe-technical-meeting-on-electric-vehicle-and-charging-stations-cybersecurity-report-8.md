## Appendix A - Electric Vehicle Technical Standards Overview
There are many standards to be found in the EV environment such as those that apply to EVSEs e.g. type of charger (DC or AC), type of charging plug etc. However without standards (even competing ones) there would be no hope of achieving interoperability within the EV environment and the table below contains a brief overview of some of the more technical standards found in the EV environment that could be impacted by EV and charging infrastructure cybersecurity. Standards also make it easier to develop requirements that can be unambiguous.
