## II. OVERVIEW

TPC Section 21.19 took effect on September 1, 2019.<sup>7</sup> As a result, those who transmit sexually explicit visual material without the expressed consent or request of the recipient could be charged with a Class C misdemeanor and a maximum fine of $500.8 Under the new law, anyone who knowingly

On its face, TPC Section 21.19 looks like a legislative victory protecting people from digital sexual harassment and preserving the morals of our community, but there may be issues lingering in the shadows of this seemingly positive law.<sup>10</sup> The passing of this bill fills a void in Texas law— holding those who send unwanted sexually explicit pictures online accountable—and the good intentions behind it led to the initial celebration of the bill’s passing.<sup>11</sup> During Senate and House committee hearings, proponents explained that although indecent exposure is a crime, the same act committed over texting or a dating app leaves the recipient without recourse, even for repetitive offenses.<sup>12</sup> Proponents want exhibitionists to unwilling participants to receive criminal punishment just as they would in person.<sup>13</sup> Proponents also claimed this bill was needed now more than ever, as our culture of meeting others, making friends, dating, and how we live our day-to-day lives has changed drastically in recent years, moving

staggering volume of people affected and limited resources.<sup>22</sup> Others have speculated there may be evidentiary issues in certain circumstances, such as when the sender denies sending the message.<sup>23</sup> These are very real and common issues arising in cases in which a party wishes to introduce any kind of text or online message during trial—evidence often creating costly and painful delays for victims.<sup>24</sup>

For example, in order to hold an alleged sender liable for the sexually explicit picture sent to a plaintiff, the plaintiff must establish the alleged sender is indeed the offender.<sup>25</sup> Although establishing originating cell phone ownership is insufficient, the requirements of authentication are not particularly demanding and depend on a case-by-case basis whether the texts contain identifying information.<sup>26</sup> In certain circumstances, the sexually explicit material may be “distinctive” enough for the trier of fact to deem it authentic,<sup>27</sup> but, in others, parties may need to go to greater lengths to authenticate.<sup>28</sup> Even after confirming sexually explicit messages came from the accused individual’s account, some cases will still go unresolved due to the plaintiff’s inability to meet their evidentiary burden to show the

### A. *Substantial Issues with Texas Penal Code Section 21.19 *
While there should be protection for those who do not want to receive unrequested sexually explicit materials online, TPC Section 21.19 is not the proper way to ensure these protections. Although the bill was intended to fill a much-needed gap in Texas law, its extremely broad and vague language leaves it unconstitutional on its face. Undefined statutory language may also cause confusion. Several terms within the Code remain ambiguous, which could lead to misapplication of the law. First, although the bill proponents suggested the word “person” means a human being in real time,<sup>32</sup> there is no ready indicator within the law excluding drawings, sculptures, paintings, and other images of people, which could cause confusion. Further, it bans visual materials simply including the exposed person’s intimate parts,<sup>33</sup> which is unconstitutionally too broad for states to regulate under *Miller v. California.* <sup>34</sup> Finally, the law requires explicit visual materials only be sent at

<sup>29</sup>. An article by Rebekah Allen discussed an investigation by the University of Texas into a Texas senator who denied sending explicit, unwanted photos to a student although they came from his account—claiming a third party with his account information sent them. This was after members of the senator’s staff followed up with the student after he initially contacted her on LinkedIn regarding what they had spoken about. This was the same LinkedIn account later used to reference inappropriate text messages sent to the student from a phone number written on the senator’s legislative business card. *See generally* Rebekah Allen, *‘Send a Pic?’ UT Concludes Investigation, Releases Messages Texas Senator Allegedly Sent Student.,* DALL.

When legislation is proposed, there is ample consideration in order to ensure the writing encompasses the intent of the author and also to ensure those who analyze it—including parties in both the House and Senate— consider other potential issues and misinterpretations.<sup>36</sup> Although the author of H.B. 2789 wrote with the intent to protect people from harassment,<sup>37</sup> the bill would have benefitted from additional revision, as the lack thereof has left it facially unconstitutional.<sup>38</sup>

unprotected under the Constitution.<sup>41</sup> When utilizing their reserved powers, states have the power to regulate activity happening both in person and online, but these laws must not overly restrict one’s protected rights, or they will be found unconstitutional.<sup>42</sup>

A widely known regulation of the freedom of speech is the common ban of public nudity,<sup>43</sup> or “public indecency,” which some states use as their standard for illegal nudity, generally referring to acts “involving nudity or sexual activity in view of the public, often with the intent to shock, offend, or arouse.”<sup>44</sup> States and localities differ on what constitutes illegal public nudity, looking at what parts of the body must be exposed and whether the alleged nudist had a particular intent.<sup>45</sup> The Supreme Court has clearly established its view on public nudity, calling it “the evil the State seeks to prevent, whether or not it is combined with expressive activity”<sup>46</sup> and holding it is not free expression protected by the First Amendment.<sup>47</sup> The Supreme Court has affirmed the right of individual states to define and outlaw public nudity, holding the states have a duty to “protect[] societal order and morality.”<sup>48</sup> This authorization gives states leeway in enacting public indecency and nudity laws.

For example, in California, in order to be convicted of indecent exposure, “the prosecution must prove an intent to sexually arouse, or sexually insult or offend someone.”<sup>49</sup> Contrastingly, New York simply makes it a crime to not have clothes on one’s “private or intimate parts” in a public place.<sup>50</sup> In Texas: “A person commits an offense if the person knowingly engages in

any of the following acts in a public place or, if not in a public place, the person is reckless about whether another is present who will be offended or alarmed by the person’s act.”<sup>51</sup> Texas’s indecent exposure law, which criminalizes exposing oneself to others in person, combined with a lack of comparative protection for those who are exposed to the same type of indecency online, is what prompted Bumble’s<sup>52</sup> CEO, Whitney Wolfe, to advocate for H.B. 2789.<sup>53</sup> H.B. 2789 was codified as Section 21.19 of the Texas Penal Code in 2019, becoming the first law criminalizing the transmission of visual material depicting a person’s exposed intimate parts.<sup>54</sup>

Another widely known regulation of the freedom of speech is obscenity, which is also not protected by the First Amendment.<sup>55</sup> The actual definition of obscenity varies from one community to another, and the Supreme Court established a three-part test for obscenity in *Miller v. California.* <sup>56</sup> In determining whether works are obscene, the trier of fact must consider three guiding principles, including whether the works: (1) “taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, . . . [(2)] portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and . . . [(3)] do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value [taken as a whole].”<sup>57</sup> The *Miller* test for obscenity is carefully based on local community standards, as “[i]t is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read the First Amendment as requiring that the people of Maine or Mississippi accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas, or New York City.”<sup>58</sup> Therefore, each state determines what is obscene by their definition of “sexual conduct.”<sup>59</sup>

The Supreme Court has recognized “the States have a legitimate interest in prohibiting dissemination or exhibition of obscene material when the mode of dissemination carries with it a significant danger of offending the sensibilities of unwilling recipients or of exposure to juveniles.”<sup>60</sup> States, having this interest in protecting juveniles, have even gone so far as to prohibit the sale of nude magazines to minors—magazines likely not even considered obscene to adults.<sup>61</sup> *Ginsberg v. New York*<sup>62</sup> demonstrates government regulation can extend to settings where a person lacks the capacity to make a choice.<sup>63</sup> This ultimately shows the flexibility of “obscenity,” allowing states to individually adjust the definition as applied to minors even when material may not be restricted to adults. Thus, “the power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults.”<sup>64</sup> Although there is not an exhaustive and easily accessible list of what constitutes obscenity, in *Miller v. California,* the Court concluded no one would be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of materials unless they contained patently offensive “‘hard core’ sexual conduct” set out by the regulating state law.<sup>65</sup>

It is important to distinguish obscene content from other potentially offensive expression—but which does not rise up to the level of obscenity—in order to properly analyze TPC Section 21.19.<sup>66</sup> These nonobscene expressions provide more to society than senseless gestures—they contain serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.<sup>67</sup> Indecent content is an example. Indecent content is differentiated from obscene

laws and “contemporary community standards”<sup>78</sup>—but the third prong is the only one analyzed on a national standard. Obscenity must be construed on a case-by-case basis because two of the three prongs are subjective according to state and community standards.<sup>79</sup> There have also been attempts to broaden the scope of the *Miller* test on a federal level.<sup>80</sup> An example of this attempt was the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), which made it a federal crime to use the Internet to communicate commercial material considered “harmful to minors.”<sup>81</sup> COPA was ultimately held unconstitutional because it suppressed a wide range of speech adults have a right to communicate.<sup>82</sup> Despite these challenges and attempts to broaden its scope, the *Miller* test still stands as the primary standard for obscenity.<sup>83</sup>

#### 2. The Growing Trend of Content-Based Regulations 

A content-based law or regulation “discriminates against speech based on the substance of what it communicates” and is presumed unconstitutional.<sup>84</sup> This is different than a content-neutral law, which applies to expression without regard to its substance, generally regulating the time, place, and manner of speech.<sup>85</sup> Content-based restrictions of speech are subject to strict scrutiny,<sup>86</sup> the highest form of judicial review, and can only pass if the legislature “passed the law to further a ‘compelling governmental interest,’ and . . . narrowly tailored the law to achieve that

interest.”<sup>87</sup> This is regardless of the government’s “benign motive, contentneutral justification, or lack of ‘animus toward the ideas contained’ in the regulated speech.”<sup>88</sup> Although content-based restrictions are presumed unconstitutional,<sup>89</sup> the Supreme Court has provided examples that have survived strict scrutiny and are constitutional.<sup>90</sup> Some examples of constitutional content-based restrictions include: “[I]ncitement, obscenity, defamation, speech integral to criminal conduct, so-called ‘fighting words,’ child pornography, fraud, true threats, and speech presenting some grave and imminent threat the Government has the power to prevent.”<sup>91</sup> These types of restrictions are not protected due to their harmful content and effects.<sup>92</sup>

pornography.<sup>96</sup> “One of the reasons given by legislators for passing statutes protecting children from viewing pornography is that adults use such material to lure children into engaging in sexual activity.”<sup>97</sup> There is also a strong interest in protecting children from seeing and hearing not only obscene, but indecent material.<sup>98</sup> This interest is apparent both in the way states prohibit public nudity or indecent exposure and in states’ authority to restrict the selling of obscene materials to minors.<sup>99</sup> It is commonly known protecting minors from exposure to harmful visual material in the physical world is easier than doing so online.<sup>100</sup> States have even gone so far as to regulate the availability of adult theaters that have no suggestive displays on the outside of the theater to only allow consenting adults to enter.<sup>101</sup>

The Supreme Court has held “there are legitimate state interests at stake in stemming the tide of commercialized obscenity, even assuming it is feasible to enforce effective safeguards against exposure to juveniles and to passersby.”<sup>102</sup> The Supreme Court, as it held in *FCC v. Pacifica*, <sup>103</sup> also allows regulation of radio broadcasting due to its “pervasive presence,”<sup>104</sup> ability to “extend into the privacy of the home[,]” and how impossible it is to “completely . . . avoid those [broadcasts] that are patently offensive.”<sup>105</sup> This ruling allows the FCC to regulate an indecent, but not obscene, radio broadcast, and the Court further explained it “never intended to place an

absolute prohibition on the broadcast of this type of language, but rather sought to channel it to times of day when children most likely would not be exposed to it.”<sup>106</sup> Although “broadcasting obscene content is prohibited by [federal] law at all times of the day[,] [i]ndecent and profane content are [only] prohibited on broadcast TV and radio between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience.”<sup>107</sup> The desire to protect minors has been prevalent throughout the rulings regulating obscene speech, as well as speech not rising to the level of obscenity.<sup>108</sup> Although the U.S. has also successfully taken steps to protect minors from inadvertently accessing harmful material online,<sup>109</sup> blanket efforts to prevent the online transmission of material harmful to minors have failed as they are often considered too broad<sup>110</sup> and restrictive of adults’ rights to access content not necessarily considered obscene.<sup>111</sup> The Supreme Court reasoned the government may shelter minors from potentially harmful speech, but a statute doing so “is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be . . . effective in achieving the legitimate purpose” of the statute as the “burden on adult speech” would otherwise be too great.<sup>112</sup>

States must tread lightly when passing laws to regulate content sharing and be fully aware of what they can and cannot restrict. States must know in what capacity and circumstances they may restrict in order for the restriction to be constitutional.

#### *b. Banning Revenge Porn*

With the rise of the Internet and social media, revenge porn has become a new and damaging phenomenon. Revenge porn has been defined as “sexually explicit images of a person posted online without that person’s consent[,] especially as a form of revenge or harassment.”<sup>113</sup> These explicit photos are generally disseminated in “retaliation for a romantic rebuff.<sup>114</sup> They are often “accompanied by the victim’s name, address, phone number, Facebook page, and other personal information. . . . They are seen on the Internet by prospective employers and customers. Victims have been subjected to harassment, stalking, and threats of sexual assault.”<sup>115</sup> State laws prohibiting the distribution of revenge porn restrict speech on the basis of its content.<sup>116</sup> Not only are the laws considered content-based restrictions, but they have also been interpreted as being viewpointdiscriminatory,<sup>117</sup> which is defined as “singling out a particular opinion or perspective on that subject matter for treatment unlike that given to other viewpoints.”<sup>118</sup> 

Revenge porn laws can be interpreted as being viewpoint-discriminatory because non-child pornography is legal to view, watch, and distribute (to adults),<sup>119</sup> but the government wants to limit this when someone sends out these explicit images and videos with an ill-intent. The content itself is not illegal—if the person depicted in the video(s) and image(s) is of age—but the government wants to make its distribution illegal if it harbors ill-intent, which in turn singles out a particular perspective regarding the subject matter. Viewpoint discrimination is often implicated through governmental discretion.<sup>120</sup> This type of discrimination is presumed unconstitutional.<sup>121</sup>

Nevertheless, in the U.S., forty-seven states and one territory have implemented revenge porn laws.<sup>122</sup> The various states’ revenge porn laws are diverse in their punishments, ranging from misdemeanor to felony convictions.<sup>123</sup> Although revenge porn has not been recognized as an exception to the ban on content-based restrictions,<sup>124</sup> some states have written their laws in a manner narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest, surviving strict scrutiny and thus rendering them constitutional.<sup>125</sup> In 2018, the Vermont Supreme Court upheld its state’s revenge porn law against a First Amendment challenge by comparing the “state’s interest in preventing the unauthorized disclosure of intimate images with the state’s interest in other forms of content-based restrictions on speech, such as restrictions on the disclosure of medical information or social security numbers.”<sup>126</sup>

Other states have tailored their laws to meet this requirement after being previously found to be overbroad and unconstitutional.<sup>127</sup> For example, in 2014, Texas passed its own revenge porn law, prohibiting anyone from “distributing images or video showing ‘a person’s intimate parts exposed’ or engaging in sexual contact without the person’s knowledge or consent”<sup>128</sup> when the material was “[(1)] obtained by the person or created under circumstances in which the depicted person had a reasonable expectation that the visual material would remain private; [(2)] the disclosure . . . causes harm to the depicted person; and . . .

person in any manner.”<sup>129</sup> This law initially made third parties liable for the “distribution of covered content even if the defendant had no knowledge of the circumstances under which the image was taken or the privacy expectations of the person depicted. <sup>130</sup> The law was struck down as overbroad<sup>131</sup> and was subsequently amended by adding an “intent to harm a person” provision to make sure third parties were not negatively impacted.<sup>132</sup> Overall, states seem to be successful in passing revenge porn laws by narrowly tailoring them to serve a compelling interest.

### 3. Where This Leaves Us

#### a. Gaps in Texas Law—the Need to Fill a Void in Online Sexual Advances

The Internet is a relatively new and revolutionary phenomenon that has allowed people to communicate easier than ever before—almost instantaneously. Following this new technology, new laws must be implemented to protect people from an array of wrongdoing. Many of these laws punishing online offenders mimic existing laws protecting those in the “real world,” or provide unity by punishing acts done in person and online indiscriminately.<sup>133</sup> In Texas, there are harassment, revenge porn, cyberbullying, and other laws in place to combat online crimes. None of these laws are as strict, per se, as TPC Section 21.19, which makes it a crime—even on the first occasion—to knowingly transmit visual material depicting a person’s exposed intimate parts if the receiving individual did not expressly consent to or request the media.<sup>134</sup> The Texas harassment

law is somewhat similar, punishing someone who intends to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, or embarrass another by initiating “communication and in the course of the communication makes a comment, request, suggestion, or proposal that is obscene.”<sup>135</sup>

It seems both laws share, in part, the same legislative intent—to protect those who did not consent to receiving inappropriate materials—but each has different intent requirements.<sup>136</sup> Texas Penal Code Section 21.19 also seems to be written with the intent to protect those who wish to avoid this type of material in a purely social or dating atmosphere. Contrastingly, the harassment law is broader, as the criminalizing of intentionally transmitting obscene material is only one part of the law.<sup>137</sup> Texas Penal Code Section 21.19 takes a narrower approach, clarifying what is prohibited,<sup>138</sup> and becoming Texas’s only law solely focused on preventing online sexual advances. This type of law is essential in a society where it is so easy to commit indecent exposure online—anonymously, even.<sup>139</sup> Texas Penal Code Section 21.19 serves as a necessary deterrent to those who feel entitled to expose themselves through electronic means without being asked. An effective law will hopefully reduce these incidences in the long run.
