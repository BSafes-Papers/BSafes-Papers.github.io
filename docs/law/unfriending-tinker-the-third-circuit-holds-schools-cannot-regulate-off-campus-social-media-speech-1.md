## I. NOW TRENDING: THE INCREASE IN SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES

After coming across sexually explicit messages between sixteen-yearold Channing Smith and another male student, a peer shared the images to their public Instagram and Snapchat stories.<sup>1</sup> Hours later, Smith committed suicide.<sup>2</sup> Smith’s story is unfortunately not an isolated event and illustrates the tragic consequences of cyberbullying and online hate speech.<sup>3</sup> Although the two interacted in the same classroom, the incident occurred outside the classroom through the use of social media.<sup>4</sup> This raises a question that public schools across the country are facing—could school officials have done anything about the posts, or must they helplessly stand by as students like Smith fall victim to cyberbullying?

It goes without saying that social media is a popular way for teens to communicate.5 In 2019, roughly two-thirds of teens had at least one active

social media profile, and eighty-nine percent reported being online “almost constantly” or “several times a day.”<sup>6</sup> More alarming, however, is that over half reported that they have experienced some form of bullying or harassment while online.<sup>7</sup>

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted these concerns, as it increased the world’s reliance on the internet.<sup>8</sup> Once students began learning remotely and interacting with peers exclusively online, instances of cyberbullying and social media hate speech increased.<sup>9</sup> An April 2020 report published by L1ght revealed that social media hate speech among students increased seventy percent since ceasing in-person learning.<sup>10</sup> Overall, ninety percent of teens view this misuse of social media as a problem among their age group, and over fifty percent believe that teachers fail to adequately address the situation.<sup>11</sup> Students may have various theories as to why their teachers do not intervene in online bullying or harassment.<sup>12</sup> But in reality, confusion as to who has authority to intervene may cause the teachers’ hesitancy to interject.<sup>13</sup>

The U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment guarantees citizens the freedom of speech.<sup>14</sup> This right extends to online speech as well as speech that is offensive, vulgar, or controversial.<sup>15</sup> When students share questionable content on social media, schools struggle to balance this fundamental right with the need to maintain a safe academic environment.<sup>16</sup> For example, an Ohio high school suspended several students in 2018 after criticizing the school’s superintendent on Twitter.<sup>17</sup> Alternatively,

> Unaware or simply indifferent to the repercussions of public postings on the Internet, students have unveiled violent plans against themselves and others, including bomb threats and school shootings.

Regardless of a student’s motive—a cry for help, boredom, or peer pressure—a student’s out-of-school Internet speech often has an impact on his educational environment, his peers, and his community.{: .fs-2}

Princeton University recently declined to intervene when a student used a racial insult on Facebook.<sup>18</sup>

This inconsistent enforcement is prevalent not only in school districts but also in courts.<sup>19</sup> In *Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District,* <sup>20</sup> the Supreme Court clearly delineated students’ First Amendment rights *in* school.<sup>21</sup> But the Court decided *Tinker* before the invention of modern social media and has not yet extended its precedent to online speech.<sup>22</sup> This year, in B.L. *ex rel. Levy v. Mahanoy Area School District,* <sup>23</sup> the Third Circuit declined to extend the *Tinker* substantial disruption test (Tinker exception) to off-campus cyberspeech and concluded students retain full First Amendment rights outside of school.<sup>24</sup> This marked the broadest circuit court opinion about off-campus student cyberspeech thus far.<sup>25</sup> This broad-sweeping rationale differs from the Fourth Circuit’s sufficient nexus test, which is consistent with *Tinker* and properly addresses off-campus electronic speech cases.<sup>26</sup>

This Note analyzes the Third Circuit’s conclusion that the *Tinker* exception does not apply to off campus cyberspeech. Part II summarizes the
relevant Supreme Court and Court of Appeals cases, emphasizing the different approaches to off campus electronic speech. Part III discusses the
facts and procedural history of *B.L.* Part IV describes the Third Circuit’s holding in *B.L.* that students retain full First Amendment rights while using social media off campus. Part V provides a critical analysis of the Third Circuit’s holding and advocates that the Fourth Circuit’s sufficient
nexus test offers a more appropriate solution for precedential and policy reasons. Part VI illustrates the impact of *B.L.* and the need for Supreme
Court guidance.
