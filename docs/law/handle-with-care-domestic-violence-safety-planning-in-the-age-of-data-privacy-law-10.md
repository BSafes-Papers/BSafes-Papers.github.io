## X. CONCLUSION

Technology-based abuse is a prevalent form of intimate partner abuse, alongside physical, sexual, psychological, emotional, and economic abuse. The ubiquity of technology usage in everyday life makes the risk of technology-based abuse from intimate partners more common. The lack of laws and regulations to adequately address and prevent technologybased abuse makes it harder to contain and increases the risk of danger to victims. One source of technology-based abuse comes from an abuser getting access to their partner’s online data, either through an online search, purchasing data, or if they’re lucky, from a data breach.

Access to a partner’s online information allows an abuser to easily track down and harm their partner, both physically and virtually. Where the law is unable to protect or provide immediate relief to survivors, domestic violence advocates attempt to fill in the gaps, specifically through safety planning. The lack of regulations and their enforcement over new technology and its abusive use puts a heavy burden on domestic violence advocates to protect the survivor from technology-based abuse from their partner.

The implementation of consumer data privacy laws can provide some relief to victims of technology-based abuse, especially for data-driven abuse. Not only can consumer data privacy laws allow a survivor to control and protect their own data from ending up in the hands of their abusers, but they can also allow a survivor to bring a cause of action against a business instead of being forced to criminally prosecute their abuser. The change in the public’s understanding of data privacy will also implore more people to be educated and trained in best practices of data privacy management. A greater public acceptance on best practices and knowledge of online technology lessens the burden on domestic violence advocates to educate survivors on technology literacy and protecting their personal information. In addition, new domestic violence laws can draw inspiration and form strategies from current data privacy laws in how they define certain terms to provide the greatest amount of protection for survivors. As shown through the lens of data privacy, the complexity of domestic violence calls for creative solutions in all areas of the law in order to provide meaningful relief.
