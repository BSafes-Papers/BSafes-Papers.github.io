## VI. DATA AND INFORMATION-DRIVEN TECHNOLOGY ABUSE
One area of technology-based abuse is harm derived from an abuser’s access to their partner’s personal data.<sup>118</sup>In cyberstalking cases, abusers often obtain online data about their partners for monitoring or harassment purposes. This method may be done by hacking into a partner’s email and

social media accounts and using that information to locate and further harass their partner. 

### A. *Current Abuses of Data-Driven Technology*
A nightmare scenario of data-driven technology-based abuse is presented in *Remsburg v. Docusearch, Inc.*, where a New Hampshire customer paid an Internet-based investigation service to look up the date of birth, address, social security number, and employment information for a woman.<sup>119</sup> The company obtained and transferred the requested information to the customer, who then used the information to track down the woman at her job where he fatally shot her and then himself.<sup>120</sup> Today, rather than paying an investigation service to look for private information, many companies can directly sell the information they have on hand to consumers as more personally identifiable information becomes available on the Internet.<sup>121</sup>

Data brokers are companies that primarily collect and sell personal consumer information.<sup>122</sup> In *Remsburg*, the investigation company obtained the victim’s employment information by giving her a telephone call. <sup>123</sup> Data brokers would instead obtain this information from harvesting the Internet for publicly available data, such as public records, social networking content, and blogs as well as from purchasing private data from digital services that buy data from social media companies, <sup>124</sup> and from online retailers, including eBay and Amazon. <sup>125</sup> The ease in obtaining personal data, its lucrative market value, and the lack of preventative legal measures could likely make situations like *Remsburg* easy to replicate. Domestic violence survivors are more at risk of having their data harvested, especially where the data of women consumers are abundant and highly valued in the big data industry<sup>126</sup> and where the majority of domestic violence victims are women. <sup>127</sup>

The New Hampshire Supreme Court held that the investigation company was liable for selling a person’s work address obtained by a pretextual phone call. <sup>128</sup> Nevertheless, it found no cause of action for appropriation because the company sold the information for its value.<sup>129</sup> The investigation company had a duty to exercise reasonable care in disclosing personal information because the risk of criminal misconduct was sufficiently foreseeable, even though employment information is not considered privileged. <sup>130</sup> However, the court noted that this narrow exception runs against the general presumption that “a private citizen has no general duty to protect others from the criminal attacks of third parties.”<sup>131</sup> The courts have yet to restrict the sale of data under common or statutory law.<sup>132</sup>

### *B. Future Abuses of Data-Driven Technology*
Domestic violence survivors and advocates need to be aware of the new threats arising as a result of the high-speed and unregulated growth of new technology. New technologies are constantly being released to the public without a full assessment of their collateral impact on vulnerable populations. <sup>133</sup> One particular tool that is concerning for domestic violence survivors is facial recognition systems fueled by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. AI-enabled systems are “fed” large amounts of data so that the system can “learn” from the data in order to recognize, identify, and target a specific subject.<sup>134</sup> One example of an AI-enabled system is predictive policing software that calculates an individual’s likelihood to commit a crime based on their social media activities and criminal history that the software has scraped off the internet and analyzed through a proprietary algorithm. <sup>135</sup>

#### **1) Clearview and Facial Recognition Technology**
While AI-enabled facial recognition technology has been utilized as early as 2011, the tech industry has not explored it further as the system is acknowledged to be too dangerous for mass distribution without further

studies on its impact or accompanied regulations to reduce risks of harmful use. <sup>136</sup> If technology companies are required to understand how its products can be used consciously and unconsciously to harm survivors, particularly those from Black and immigrant communities, <sup>137</sup> policymakers and law enforcement can more adequately craft targeted and instructive laws and regulations to effectively prevent and prosecute technology-based abuse. This requirement may also force companies to conduct a more thoughtful risk assessment on its products before releasing it to market. However, a company called Clearview decided to ignore this industry acknowledgement by not only engineering its own facial recognition tool (which works by scraping images on the internet to “learn” an image and performing a Google search on a person’s face) but also by selling it on the open market. <sup>138</sup> Surprisingly, Clearview’s application of its technology was found not in violation of any existing federal laws.<sup>139</sup>

Clearview initially sold its technology to law enforcement agencies to identify suspects (such as shoplifters)from surveillance cameras or smartphone recordings, with an expressed interest in expanding its market to private companies and consumers. <sup>140</sup> Clearview has since sold its technology to government entities such as public schools, the Department of Justice, (which oversee immigration enforcement), and private companies. <sup>141</sup> These private companies include Macy’s, the National Basketball Association (NBA), and a sovereign wealth fund in the United Arab Emirates, where homosexuality is criminalized. <sup>142</sup> In addition, Clearview has provided individual friends and investors access to its technology; these friends and investorsthen share the technology with their own networks. <sup>143</sup> The lack of regulation and oversight over Clearview’s potential buyers reveals the technology’s immediate harm to vulnerable groups like children, undocumented immigrants, LBGTQ+ individuals, as well as potential harm to women and domestic violence survivors.

Providing unregulated access to facial recognition technology poses a clear danger, where a stranger can take a photo of someone, feed it through the software, and identify the person based on their internet foottraffic. <sup>144</sup> John Catsimatidis, the owner of New York City-based grocery chain Gristedes, tested Clearview’s app at his stores to identify shoplifters.<sup>145</sup> He also used the app to identify an unknown man, who went on a date with his daughter without either person’s consent, and discovered the man’s name, age, and profession. <sup>146</sup> If this app fell in the hands of an abuser who is stalking their partner, escape from an abuser would be impossible.

#### **2) Threat from Lack of Regulations and Oversight**
The lack of legal restrictions over the creation or application of new technologies is troubling, particularly with the knowledge that new tools that can potentially harm vulnerable people, including intimate partners, can be freely funded. For example, Clearview has received $7 million in venture capital funding to develop its technology. <sup>147</sup> Currently, no laws or regulations exist that can prevent private investors from investing in controversial technological advances. <sup>148</sup> Additionally, there are no laws, regulations, or oversight that address how government agencies can utilize new technologies such as facial recognition without much familiarity with either the vendor or the technology. <sup>149</sup> In addition, no existing laws or regulations seem capable of forcing Clearview or other AI companies to comply with requests from social media companies to stop scraping images from its websites.<sup>150</sup> Too much regulation in technology development can

stifle innovation and growth of groundbreaking products.<sup>151</sup> However, the lack of minimum regulation and oversight on how new technology is funded, distributed, and used is worrisome, particularly when analyzing technology-based abuse in intimate relationships.

#### **3) Threat from Unauthorized Access to Private Data**

One reason the public knows as much as it does about Clearview AI is due to a data breach that resulted in the publicization of its customers list.<sup>152</sup> Clearview’s attorney explained that “data breaches are part of life in the twenty-first century.”<sup>153</sup> However, the fact that Clearview not only holds a massive volume of private information but can also give its powerful clients access to this data with no oversight cannot justify this reality. If such information gets in the hands of data brokers or the illegal online marketplace, we can expect more devastating cases like Remsburg to become normal occurrences.

However, there is already an organization that holds massive amounts of private data on domestic violence survivors: the government. Courts have used sophisticated, centralized case management systems to ensure efficiency and accuracy in domestic violence cases. These systems synchronize important information on domestic violence cases between judges, attorneys, clients, and other involved community members, including law enforcement, domestic violence advocates, health care workers, and batterers’ intervention programs. <sup>154</sup> The Brooklyn Felony Domestic Violence Court of New York State uses its own proprietary data management system which allows instantaneous sharing of information between multiple parties. <sup>155</sup> The courts’ reliance on case management systems creates a security concern because of the amount of personal data in a singular source, especially in the event of a data breach that may jeopardize a victim’s safety.<sup>156</sup>

Limiting access to personal data held by the government is critical in protecting the safety of survivors. However, the ability to prevent unlawful

access is made more difficult by data breaches in private data-driven products used by public agencies as well as by direct cyberattacks on the government. In 2019, there were 140 ransomware attacks targeting state and local government that exposed sensitive public data to danger. <sup>157</sup> While ransomware works by preventing access to computer systems and public databases, such as online payment sites or crime data statistics, it is not difficult to believe attackers could easily access these databases and sell the information within them. <sup>158</sup> Even if public agencies were able to protect their data from ransomware, they would not be able to protect data held by a vendor in the event of a data breach on the vendor’s end. <sup>159</sup> A potential data breach on any private or public domestic violence case management system could expose domestic violence survivors to grave danger.<sup>160</sup>

Another data-related problem illustrated by Clearview’s business practices is the unfettered access to powerful technological tools coupled with the underlying data that companies are willing to give to individuals. Abusers are numerous and come in different shapes and forms. If a vendor gives broad access to its technology to its buyers without implementing safety measures regarding who can use the technology, their level of use, or mitigation plans for unauthorized usage, they may unknowingly give access to an abuser who can then use the technology to harm their partners. For example, law enforcement officers are likely to have access to highly sensitive databases, including domestic violence case management systems. Law enforcement officers have also been found to commit higher rates of intimate partner violence compared to the general public. <sup>161</sup> Police abuse of confidential information to retaliate against an intimate partner is
