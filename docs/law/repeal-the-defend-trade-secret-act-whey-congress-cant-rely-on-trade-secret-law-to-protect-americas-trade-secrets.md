## I. INTRODUCTION
“[T]here are only ‘two categories’ of companies affected by trade secret theft — ‘[T]hose [sic] that know they’ve been compromised and those that don’t know yet.’” <sup>1</sup> Whether you imagine a cyber thief subverting a company’s network defenses or an employee selling secret information to a competitor, trade secret theft is a real threat. The epidemic has ballooned to such proportions- $600 billion –that combatting trade secret theft enjoys bipartisan congressional support.<sup>2</sup> Despite Congress’s best efforts, there is no evidence the bleeding has slowed, much less stopped.<sup>3</sup>

By its very nature, trade secret protection requires a delicate balance, unlike traditional intellectual property. Within the intellectual property framework, trade secrets are an enigma. Traditional intellectual property law grants inventors and artists legal protection for *sharing* their innovations; however, the government grants protection to trade secret owners who *withhold* their innovations.<sup>4</sup>

The term “trade secret” likely brings to mind something like Coca-Cola’s secret formula; however, the law extends protection to less-obvious examples, such as a list of customer names or employee know-how.<sup>5</sup>

If you accept Attorney General Holder’s position that every company has been compromised from trade secret theft, then Coca-Cola deserves a “shoutout.” Hundreds of years after the popular syrup was invented, the secret formula remains a secret. The lengths Coca-Cola has gone to protect the formula is legendary.<sup>6</sup> For example, the company retreated from India to avoid disclosing the formula to the government.<sup>7</sup> Coca-Cola defied a court order requiring them to produce the formula during a lawsuit between the company and its bottlers.<sup>8</sup> Coca-Cola illustrates the true value of its secret formula through its extraordinary efforts to protect it. Instead of relying on a legal safety net, the company itself guards its most precious treasure.

Not all companies are as successful as Coca-Cola. In 2016, thieves siphoned an estimated $600 billion worth of trade secrets from United States companies; in response, Congress passed the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA).<sup>9</sup> The DTSA gives trade secret owners powerful tools to prevent their secrets from being disclosed and provides a private right of action for trade secret owners in federal court.<sup>10</sup> Despite Congress’s noble intentions, the DTSA fails to protect America’s trade secrets and actually harms domestic innovation. This Note argues for the repeal of the DTSA.

Trade secret law attempts to protect unfair competitive advantages by preventing disclosure of the secret itself; however, companies rarely litigate over secrets like the Coca-Cola formula.<sup>11</sup> Instead, employers predominantly use trade secret litigation as a means to limit employee mobility and reduce legitimate competition.<sup>12</sup> As a result, trade secret law reduces innovation while also failing to deter trade secret theft. Trade secret owners themselves, not Congress or the courts, are in the best position to prevent their secrets from being stolen.

This Note briefly describes trade secret history, as well as the DTSA’s legislative history and two legislative sources: the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA). Secondly, this Note describes DTSA’s major provisions and analyzes how the law is used, and reviews how the courts interpret the Act. Finally, this Note argues that trade secret law disproportionately and negatively affects employees and small businesses. Congress must repeal DTSA, shift its paradigm from *preventing* trade secret theft, and focus on *actual* trade secret theft as an unfair method of competition.

## II. BACKGROUND

### A. TRADE SECRET HISTORY – AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ENIGMA

Compared to traditional intellectual property law, trade secrets were born an oddity.<sup>13</sup>  Although some scholars trace trade secret law to the Roman empire,<sup>14</sup> modern trade secret law emerged from common law roots in Massachusetts during the early 19th century.<sup>15</sup> Trade secret law evolved from tort and contract doctrines, where conflicts usually involved a breach of a confidential relationship between employer and employee, or a trade secret owner and a bad-faith actor.<sup>16</sup>

The argument that trade secrets do not belong under the intellectual property “umbrella” at all is a strong one. Intellectual property law encourages public disclosure of scientific advancements in exchange for legal protection.<sup>17</sup> The government incentivizes innovation by granting exclusive rights to inventors, for a limited duration, so the world can build upon the advancements and creativity of others.<sup>18</sup>

In contrast, as the name implies, trade secret owners are entitled to legal redress for not disclosing their innovations. “Indeed, the very assumptions underlying patent and copyright laws—that government-granted rights can serve to incentivize the creation and sharing of new ideas and expression—are diametrically opposed to the notion of keeping information secret to gain a competitive advantage.” <sup>19</sup> A “trade secret owner is rewarded for keeping information . . . away from the public for an unlimited duration.” <sup>20</sup> Despite these differences, and as this Note highlights, trade secret law plays an important complementary role to patent law.

### B. WHAT IS A TRADE SECRET?

Generally, a trade secret is anything not commonly known by those within the industry and derives independent economic value;<sup>21</sup> however, a trade secret owner must take reasonable steps to protect the secret before they can assert a claim for misappropriation.<sup>22</sup> Misappropriation claims require allegations that a defendant improperly acquired, used, or threatened to acquire or use, the trade secret.<sup>23</sup> Unlike a patent owner, a trade secret owner has no claim against a defendant who obtained the same secret through independent research, or even reverse engineering.<sup>24</sup>

Generally, trade secret issues arise in three contexts: “competitive intelligence, business transactions, and departing employees.” <sup>25</sup> Competitive intelligence describes attempts to acquire information about a competitor, and courts must determine if the conduct used was “improper.” <sup>26</sup> Usually, improper conduct invokes an independent legal wrong in the form of trespass, theft, bribery, and so on.<sup>27</sup>

Trade secret litigation that stems from a business transaction or a departing employee typically involves a breach of a pre-existing relationship.<sup>28</sup> Improper conduct in this context is analogous to a breach of contract, where the trade secret owner asserts the defendant failed to abide by the terms of their agreement, implied or otherwise.<sup>29</sup>

Distilled into its various pieces, trade secret law is merely a patchwork of various legal doctrines brought together under one umbrella. For this reason, some scholars label trade secret law as “parasitic” and question the need for trade secret law altogether.<sup>30</sup> Other scholars recognize “the economic benefits that flow from [trade secret law’s] existence, most notably incentives for businesses to spend less money protecting secret information . . . [and] as a means for the public to enforce populist norms about ‘commercial ethics.’” <sup>31</sup>

### C. TRADE SECRET PROTECTION V. PATENT PROTECTION

Given the choice, companies balance several considerations when deciding between trade secret protection and patent protection.<sup>32</sup> For example, a trade secret owner’s “right to sue is triggered only when the secret is wrongfully used or taken.” <sup>33</sup> A patent owner enjoys a government-granted monopoly.<sup>34</sup> At the same time, patents are costly to acquire<sup>35</sup> and even more to protect;<sup>36</sup> whereas, the costs imposed on trade secret owners are theoretically proportional to the value of the secret itself.

“Judges and lawyers have sometimes reasoned that because trade secret law provides less protection to the inventor than patent law does, no rational person who makes a patentable invention would fail to seek a patent . . . . That reasoning is unsound.” <sup>37</sup> Trade secret and patent law counter-balance each other in cost and duration. For example, the “disclosure required by patent law may enable a competitor to invent around the patent in less time than it would take him to discover the inventor’s secret.” <sup>38</sup> More salient, if a patent owner sued for infringement, “patent litigation [is] very costly . . . [and] a patentee puts his patent at risk of being held invalid;” <sup>39</sup> thus, the patentee endures the sunk cost of obtaining the patent to begin with. “One way to avoid infringement is not to patent.” <sup>40</sup> Continuing on the theme of patent costs, an inventor may believe their invention is only of modest value and not worth the time and fees a patent requires. In that instance, trade secret protection is an enticing alternative where the cost of protecting the secret would be proportional to its modest value.<sup>41</sup>

***
<sup>32</sup> This is true where businesses have the option to choose between patent or trade secret protection. Patent protection is limited to a “process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter.” 35 U.S.C. § 101 (2012). Trade secret protection covers a wider swath of information. Thus, businesses only confront this choice when patentability overlaps with trade secret protection.

Trade secret protection fills gaps created by the patent scheme. For example, obtaining a twenty-year monopoly for an invention that technology is likely to outpace in five years is sub-optimal. Considered together, trade secret law and patent law “reflect the fact that patent law cannot be tailored finely enough to cover every [invention].” <sup>42</sup>

As this Note will show, the Defend Trade Secrets Act significantly increased trade secret liability, which may push businesses away from the patent process.<sup>43</sup>Initially, this appears to be a boon for small businesses and startups who may be deterred by patent costs; however, trade secret law is more damaging to smaller firms because of its implications for employee mobility.<sup>44</sup> Because businesses use trade secret law primarily to control employee know-how and limit mobility, the law actively reduces innovation.<sup>45</sup>

### D. EVOLUTION OF THE DEFEND TRADE SECRETS ACT

Although born from the common law,<sup>46</sup> modern trade secret law was predominantly codified by state legislation, until Congress passed the DTSA.<sup>47</sup> The majority of states have adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, in various forms, as the basis for their trade secret law.<sup>48</sup> At the federal level before DTSA, the Attorney General was solely responsible for protecting American trade secrets from economic espionage.<sup>49</sup> The escalating instances of trade secret theft, and the perception that state-level trade secret law is inadequate to mitigate the threat, led Congress to pass DTSA in order to protect America’s competitive advantage–innovation.<sup>50</sup> “Trade secrets are an integral part of a company’s competitive advantage in today’s economy, and with the increased digitization of critical data and increased global trade, this information is highly susceptible to theft.”<sup>51</sup>

The Defend Trade Secrets Act amends the Economic Espionage Act (EEA), but it also draws substantially from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) that most states have implemented in some form.<sup>52</sup> Thus, one cannot fully understand the DTSA without understanding its two primary sources.

#### 1. *The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA)*

The Uniform Trade Secrets Act is the result of ten years of research and labor from the Uniform Law Commission.<sup>53</sup> In response to uneven development of state trade secret law, as well as the inherent conflict between the goal of trade secrets (to prevent the distribution of innovation) and the goal of patent law (to encourage the distribution of innovation), the Special Committee on the Uniform Trade Secrets Act formed on February 17, 1968.<sup>54</sup> The Special Committee sought to establish a compromise between patents and trade secrets, as well as define the precise contours of trade secret law that litigants and courts could effectively rely upon.<sup>55</sup> The Special Committee concluded its work in 1979, when the Uniform Law Commission recommended UTSA for enactment. <sup>56</sup> UTSA would undergo minor clarifying amendments in 1985, but has otherwise remained intact.<sup>57</sup> As of this writing, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, District of Columbia, and forty-eight states have adopted the UTSA—most recently, Massachusetts in 2018.<sup>58</sup> Although UTSA has been widely adopted, not every state adopted the statute in its entirety, and not every state court has interpreted its provisions in the same way.<sup>59</sup> This variability affects multi-state companies most, since state law provided the only private right of action for trade secret theft until the Defend Trade Secrets Act passed in 2016.<sup>60</sup>

#### *2. The Economic Espionage Act*

By 1996, foreign and domestic trade secret theft incidents was on the rise.<sup>61</sup> Notable at this time, Congress considered foreign intellectual property theft a national security concern that had no meaningful remedy at law.<sup>62</sup> Congress responded to this threat with the Economic Espionage Act, a criminal statute intended to arm prosecutors with the legal weapons necessary to protect U.S. interests.<sup>63</sup> While deliberating, Congress actually considered adding a private cause of action to the original EEA, but some legislators expressed concern combining private civil remedies into a criminal bill.<sup>64</sup> Congress intended to revisit this idea later in the term,<sup>65</sup> but it would be twenty years before Congress fulfilled its intention.

> [The Economic Espionage Act] will help us crack down on acts like software piracy and copyright infringement that cost American businesses billions of dollars in lost revenues . . . [and] makes the theft of misappropriation of trade secrets a Federal crime. . . . [The EEA also] strengthens protection for our national information infrastructure by eliminating gaps in the criminal laws covering attacks against computers and the information they contain. . . . This Act will protect the trade secrets of all businesses operating in the United States . . . from economic espionage and trade secret theft . . . . <sup>66</sup>

Despite these lofty expectations, the EEA produced only 125 indictments and ten convictions.<sup>67</sup> Meanwhile, in 2012, the Director of the National Security Agency, General Keith Alexander, declared the loss of “industrial information and intellectual property through cyber espionage . . . the ‘greatest transfer of wealth in history’”. <sup>68</sup> In 2013, an independent and bipartisan commission estimated United States businesses lost over $300 billion annually from intellectual property theft. <sup>69</sup>  Four years later, the same commission estimated that the value of trade secret theft could be as high as $600 billion.<sup>70</sup> The EEA failed to deter, punish, or even slow industrial espionage, and Congress noticed.

DTSA’s origins stretch back to 2012, when Senators Orrin Hatch and Christopher Coons led the initial reform effort.<sup>71</sup> That bill eventually died,<sup>72</sup> but the House resurrected the effort in 2014, which became the basis for DTSA in the Senate.<sup>73</sup> Since 2012, only 1% to 3% of proposed legislation has been enacted into law.<sup>74</sup> The Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) not only survived the congressional grind, but also did so relatively quickly for major legislation.<sup>75</sup> Buoyed by bipartisan support<sup>76</sup> and a $1.25 million lobbying effort from private industries,<sup>77</sup> DTSA became law on May 11, 2016, 287 days after its introduction in the Senate.<sup>78</sup>

Congress criticized America’s inadequate trade secret protections as justification for the Defend Trade Secrets Act. Despite economic espionage being a “top priority for Federal law enforcement,” limited resources in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Justice (DOJ) prohibited effective enforcement of the Economic Espionage Act.<sup>79</sup> Additionally, Congress sympathized with trade secret owners who relied on state courts to respond to multi-national trade secret theft.80 In particular, state implemented UTSA variations, although relatively minor, nonetheless led to different judicial interpretations that were case-dispositive.<sup>81</sup>

“Protecting trade secrets has become increasingly difficult given everevolving technological advancements. Thieves are using increasingly sophisticated methods to steal trade secrets and the growing use of technology and cyberspace has made trade secret theft detection particularly difficult.” <sup>82</sup> Congress intends to give trade secret owners “redress in Federal court, just as owners of other forms of intellectual property . . . can seek remedies in Federal court for violations of their rights. . . . This narrowly drawn legislation will *provide a single, national standard* for trade secret misappropriation with *clear rules and predictability* for everyone involved.” <sup>83</sup> Just like the EEA, the DTSA faces lofty goals.

### E. DTSA PROVISIONS

Before assessing DTSA’s performance against Congress’s objectives, it is imperative to understand the statute’s provisions. The following sections walk through DTSA’s major provisions and Congress’s stated intentions behind them.

#### *1. Unifying Trade Secret Definitions*
Before its passage, legal scholars criticized the draft versions of the DTSA for not aligning statutory definitions with the UTSA. Scholars argued these differences would undermine Congress’s intent to “harmonize” the trade secret laws.<sup>84</sup> Perhaps in response to this criticism, Congress amended DTSA’s definitions so they mirror the UTSA. The DTSA defines a “trade secret” as:

> All forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or codes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether or how stored, compiled or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing if:

Minn. 2015) (determining whether Minnesota or California law applied would be dispositive since the case involved a claim applying the “inevitable disclosure doctrine,” which California does not recognize).

> (a) the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret; and

> (b) the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, another person who can obtain economic value from the disclosure or use of the information.<sup>85</sup>

Simply put, the DTSA makes clear that “nearly any type of information can qualify as a trade secret, as long as the owner took reasonable steps to keep it a secret and the information derives economic value from its secrecy.” <sup>86</sup> This definition closely aligns with the UTSA. The EEA “trade secret” definition required the secret to be not readily ascertainable through proper means by “the public”; this variation from the UTSA caused some courts to apply meaningful distinction to this difference.<sup>87</sup> In the DTSA, Congress clarified that it “does not intend for the definition of a trade secret to be meaningfully different from the scope of that definition as understood by courts in States that have adopted the UTSA.” <sup>88</sup> The DTSA also included language explicitly declaring reverse engineering and independent derivation as proper means of acquiring a trade secret.<sup>89</sup>

#### *2. DTSA Statute of Limitations*
Both the DTSA and the UTSA have a three-year statute of limitations period.<sup>90</sup> Congress did this despite “a number of States” enacting different limitations periods than the UTSA.<sup>91</sup> Additionally, DTSA’s three-year limitations period is a reduction from the five-year limitations period afforded by the EEA.<sup>92</sup> Congress also significantly increased the criminal penalties for trade secret theft in the DTSA amendment.<sup>93</sup> Given that Congress admitted limited resources prohibited the Department of Justice from enforcing one of its “top priorit[ies],” <sup>94</sup> reducing the statute of limitations period while increasing criminal penalties is a curious decision. Combined, these factors encourage more collaboration between the government and trade secret owners. Congress clearly expects private actions will lead, not supplement, public enforcement. This is a good strategy so long as the private business interest aligns with the government.

#### *3. DTSA’s Private Right of Action*
The most dramatic amendment provides the first federal private right of action for trade secret owners. “An owner of a trade secret that is misappropriated may bring a civil action under this subsection if the trade secret is related to a product or service used in, or intended for use in, interstate or foreign commerce.” <sup>95</sup> This provision replaced language in the EEA that gave the Attorney General exclusive access to federal courts.<sup>96</sup>

Perhaps the most impactful DTSA provision though, is actually a hold-over from the EEA. “[T]his chapter shall not be construed to preempt or displace any other remedies, whether civil or criminal, provided by United States Federal, State, commonwealth, possession, or territory law for the misappropriation of a trade secret . . . .”<sup>97</sup> No preemption means trade secret owners have the option to pursue either a state action, federal action, or both simultaneously.<sup>98</sup>

#### *4. DTSA Civil Remedies*
DTSA gives trade secret owners two civil remedies: injunctive relief and monetary damages.<sup>99</sup> Congress carefully crafted the injunctive language over concerns about DTSA’s impact on employee mobility.<sup>100</sup> Injunctive relief is intended to “prevent any actual or threatened misappropriation.” <sup>101</sup> Injunctive relief is commonly raised in the context of an employee leaving for a competing firm.<sup>102</sup> Employers also use injunctive relief proactively through non-compete agreements that limit an employee’s future options.<sup>103</sup> In either situation, injunctive relief is meant to prevent trade secret disclosure, but at a cost to employee mobility.

States have varying levels of tolerance for using trade secret law as a method to limit employee mobility. For example, the “inevitable disclosure doctrine,”made famous in *PepsiCo, Inc. v. Redmond*, stands as an example of a very employerfriendly application of trade secret law.<sup>104</sup> In that case, Pepsi successfully argued for injunctive relief against a former senior executive who accepted a position with Pepsi’s competitor, Quaker Oats.<sup>105</sup> Pepsi never alleged that their former employee stole trade secrets, used trade secrets, or otherwise misappropriated trade secrets as defined by the statute.<sup>106</sup> Instead, Pepsi argued their former employee, even acting in good-faith, would *inevitably rely* on intimate knowledge of Pepsi’s marketing, distribution, and pricing strategy in their new position.<sup>107</sup> Interpreting the Illinois Trade Secret Act (ITSA), derived substantially from the UTSA, the Seventh Circuit agreed with Pepsi and upheld the injunction granted by the district court against Pepsi’s former employee.<sup>108</sup> In stark contrast to Illinois, California has explicitly rejected the inevitable disclosure doctrine and even refuses to enforce non-compete agreements.<sup>109</sup>

Congress, sensitive to these disparate views, sought to dodge this hornet nest by not preempting state law, and explicitly provided protections for employees within DTSA’s provisions. Under DTSA, a court may grant an injunction so long as:

> (1) the order does not “prevent a person from entering into an employment relationship, and that conditions placed on such employment shall be based on evidence of threatened misappropriation and not merely on the information the person knows;” <sup>110</sup> or

> (2) the injunction otherwise does not “conflict with an applicable State law prohibiting restraints on the practice of a lawful profession, trade, or business.”<sup>111</sup>

Therefore, since DTSA does not preempt state law, and injunctive relief is granted so long as it does not conflict with state law, Congress intended for these provisions to “coexist” with local state law.<sup>112</sup>

DTSA also allows the court, in “exceptional circumstances,” to proscribe a royalty paid to the trade secret owner whenever an injunction would be “inequitable.” <sup>113</sup> Royalties are also available in lieu of other monetary damages measured by the actual loss of the trade secret, including any unjust enrichment the defendant has realized above the value of that loss.<sup>114</sup> Congress though, prefers “first [to] halt the misappropriator’s use and dissemination” of the secret, followed by the award of “appropriate damages.” <sup>115</sup> Finally, a trade secret owner may seek “exemplary damages” worth twice as much as the compensatory damages awarded “if the trade secret is willfully and maliciously misappropriated.” <sup>116</sup>

#### *5. Deterring Trade Secret Trolls* 
The DTSA expands trade secret owners’ available forums, and significantly increases a defendant’s liability. This naturally creates an environment for “trolls.” Troll is a term used to refer to litigants who bring frivolous claims hoping to leverage the significant cost of litigation (in time and money) and extract a valuable settlement.<sup>117</sup> Modeled after the UTSA, Congress attempts to deter trolls with a provision that grants attorney fees whenever a misappropriation claim is made in bad faith.<sup>118</sup>

#### *6. Ex Parte Seizures*
DTSA’s most innovative provision, if not the most impactful, is the statutory authority granted to courts for the “seizure of property necessary to prevent the propagation or dissemination of the trade secret.” <sup>119</sup> This provision is based on the Lanham Act.<sup>120</sup> The Lanham Act, which generally governs trademark protections, uses *ex parte* seizures primarily for retrieving counterfeit goods.<sup>121</sup> Although innovative, this provision is also controversial in the context of trade secret law because the government seizes a defendant’s property without providing advance notice.<sup>122</sup> Congress limited *ex parte* seizure to “extraordinary circumstances,” <sup>123</sup> and its use is subject to numerous requirements.<sup>124</sup> Despite significantly limiting its use, Congress expected this provision would be an important enforcement tool and required the Federal Judicial Center to publish a “best practices” report two years after DTSA’s enactment.<sup>125</sup>

Much like the EEA before it, DTSA is expected to deliver on very lofty goals. Congress amended the EEA “largely in response to fears of misappropriation of U.S. trade secrets by foreign actors.” <sup>126</sup> DTSA, however, is also supposed to “harmonize” state law differences by “provid[ing] a single, national standard for trade secret misappropriation.” <sup>127</sup> Immediately after Congress enacted DTSA, critics offered their predictions on how likely DTSA would achieve its goals. The next section walks through the major critiques of trade secret law generally, and then the DTSA specifically

### F. TRADE SECRET LAW CRITICISMS

#### *1. Cyber Espionage*
Despite strong bipartisan support in Congress, and “support from the intellectual property bar, including the Intellectual Property Law Section of the American Bar Association and the American Intellectual Property Law Association,” <sup>128</sup> DTSA received mixed reactions from the academic legal community. Law professors lobbied against DTSA’s passage, arguing that its provisions do not serve the underlying goals of the legislation:<sup>129</sup> (a) to create a federal civil cause of action, (b) establish a uniform and predictable trade secret law, and (c) promote innovation by protecting American businesses from misappropriation.<sup>130</sup>

The legislative history implies Congress intended for the DTSA to combat cyber espionage from foreign adversaries.<sup>131</sup> Cyber espionage is partially responsible for the “greatest transfer of wealth” in history,<sup>132</sup> directly targeting American trade secrets.<sup>133</sup> DTSA critics argue that this legislation does not address that threat, and any focus on cyber espionage “may be misplaced.”<sup>134</sup>

There is substantial evidence that supports the notion trade secret law is illsuited, or perhaps misused, as a means to deter or punish cyber espionage.<sup>135</sup> A 2010 study from O’Melveny & Myers LLP revealed that 93 percent of state trade secret cases “involved an insider, either an employee or a business partner. The percentage was 85 percent in federal cases.” <sup>136</sup> In another study, “the Economic Espionage Act echo[ed] these numbers. [The study] reviewed all 124 prosecutions conducted by the government between the law’s enactment in 1996 and 2012. . . . [In] more than 90 percent of cases, the defendant was an insider, either an employee or business partner.” <sup>137</sup> Even in the midst of growing cyber theft, the majority of trade secret litigation implicated employees who have access to the information by virtue of their position within the company.<sup>138</sup> In this way, strengthening trade secret protection only strengthens an employer’s leverage over employees. This advances policies that limit employee mobility and reduces marketplace competition while doing little to address cyber misappropriation.<sup>139</sup>

#### *2. Trade Secrets Should Not Be Federalized*
The legal academic community also criticized Congress’s desire to federalize trade secrets.<sup>140</sup> As mentioned earlier in this Note, trade secret law draws from other legal areas, such as tort and contracts, which are traditionally state law issues.<sup>141</sup> Federalizing trade secrets may promote uniformity in the law, but it also limits competition between the states for businesses and labor.<sup>142</sup> Justice Brandeis famously explained federalism’s benefits as a means for “states to ‘serve as a laboratory[] and try novel social and economic experiments’ . . . to address the same issue or problem, ‘from which the best solution may ultimately emerge.’”<sup>143</sup> A federal alternative that primarily impacts employee mobility and marketplace competition hampers the states’ ability to compete for labor and business, which this Note addresses in more detail later.

Turning away from trade secret public policy goals, specific criticism of the Defend Trade Secrets Act provisions generally falls into two buckets: no state
law preemption, and the *ex parte* provision.

### G. DTSA CRITICISM
#### *1. DTSA’s Failure to Preempt State Law*
As discussed earlier, Congress intended for the DTSA to “co-exist” alongside State UTSA laws<sup>144</sup> but also “harmonize” the various laws.<sup>145</sup> This is explicit in the DTSA’s language,<sup>146</sup> as well as its legislative history.<sup>147</sup> DTSA supporters and critics predicted that the failure to preempt state law would result in less harmonization, increased internal and litigation costs, uneven application of the law, and anticompetitive abuses against small businesses.<sup>148</sup>

Without preemption, DTSA does not “harmonize” the law, but instead “simply adds another layer of protection over the patchwork of state laws.” <sup>149</sup> Although Congress recognized that the minor differences in state laws sometimes proved to be dispositive,<sup>150</sup> Congress merely provided trade secret owners with more litigation options and simultaneously introduced uncertainty for potential defendants.<sup>151</sup> “Defendants do not get to decide whether they will be sued under federal or state law.” <sup>152</sup> DTSA incentivizes forum shopping, and shifts “the balance of litigious power toward plaintiffs and away from defendants.” <sup>153</sup> By adding another layer of variability, DTSA makes it more difficult for potential defendants to understand their scope of liability.<sup>154</sup> Adding complexity also increases litigation costs, which critics predicted would chill “innovation and . . . growth of the American economy.” <sup>155</sup>

Preemption, presumably, cures these ills.<sup>156</sup> Preemption limits a plaintiffs’ incentive for forum shopping and mitigates increased legal costs for businesses who need to comply with both state and federal legislation.<sup>157</sup> However, this also means the DTSA no longer “coexists” alongside state laws. Instead, Congress must take an affirmative stance on controversial trade secret issues, such as the inevitable disclosure doctrine.

#### *2. DTSA Invites Trade Secret Trolls*
DTSA critics also predicted the rise of the trade secret “troll.” <sup>158</sup> As mentioned earlier, a troll “intiat[es] lawsuits designed only to extract settlement payments or massive damage awards from scared defendants. . ..” <sup>159</sup> The term comes from the well-known patent troll.<sup>160</sup> Trade secret trolls can “cause the same drag on innovation and job growth,” <sup>161</sup> particularly because “acquiring trade secret status and initiating trade secret lawsuits – which can include separate claims involving covenants not to compete, nondisclosure agreements, and labor mobility – are significantly less expensive and time-consuming than similar activity in the patent space . . . .”<sup>162</sup> In addition to these relatively low barriers to file suit, the DTSA gives a potential trade secret troll the “extraordinary power to seize a defendant’s assets prior to judgment,” <sup>163</sup> which disproportionately shifts power to the plaintiff and risks unnecessary harm to “businesses, including many start-ups . . . wrongfully accused of trade secret misappropriation.” <sup>164</sup> Increased reward for reduced effort invites weak, if not frivolous, claims. Of course, some scholars believe the trade secret troll threat is overblown based on fundamental differences between trade secrets and patents.<sup>165</sup>

#### *3. Ex Parte Seizure Inappropriate in Trade Secret Context*

The *ex parte* provision allows courts, in extraordinary circumstances, to seize property from a defendant without notice in order to prevent trade secrets from being disclosed or used.<sup>166</sup> Congress preferred to prevent information disclosure and hoped this seizure remedy would significantly contribute towards that goal.<sup>167</sup> Rather than a tool to protect property though, some argue the *ex parte* provision is a weapon that “legally permits large corporations with sizable resources to silence less financially robust competitors, mostly in the form of exemployees.” <sup>168</sup> By allowing *ex parte* seizure of a defendant’s property, Congress arguably allows the court to seize property without proper due process of law.<sup>169</sup>

As mentioned earlier, trademark owners rely on *ex parte* seizures recovering counterfeit goods.<sup>170</sup> “[A] court will not even entertain the idea of granting an *ex parte* seizure order if allegedly counterfeit goods do not contain a* registered* trademark.” <sup>171</sup> A registered trademark gives the judge comfort that an independent examiner assessed the trademark’s protectability.<sup>172</sup> There is no independent examination for trade secrets.<sup>173</sup> Independent review and trademark registration gives the public “constructive notice that they may be infringing on an individual or entity’s property rights . . . . There is no such notice in the trade secrets context.” <sup>174</sup> Thus, “judges are forced to examine ‘the existence of a trade secret as a matter of first impression, without any guidance from an independent government examiner.’” <sup>175</sup>The Federal Judicial Center confirmed the difficulty judges face when confronted with an *ex parte* request.<sup>176</sup>

Despite these valid differences between trade secrets and trademark protection, the actual impact of *ex parte* seizures thus far dampens some of these concerns.<sup>177</sup>

### H. EMPIRICAL DTSA ANALYSIS
Studying trade secret litigation only grants limited insight into DTSA’s impacts. “Trade secret litigation can be quite expensive . . . median litigation cost for a trade secret case varied from $400,000 . . . to over $1.6 million.” <sup>178</sup> Since a defendant faces stiff monetary damages in addition to litigation costs, “it is frequently more cost-effective ‘to settle than to litigate.’” <sup>179</sup> Parallel federal and state trade secret claims exacerbate the incentive to settle.

Trade secret claims present other unique assessment problems. Some plaintiffs might prefer private alternative dispute resolution methods to avoid publicly disclosing trade secrets.<sup>180</sup> Additionally, arbitration likely siphons a portion of potential DTSA litigation,<sup>181</sup> since employment agreements commonly contain mandatory arbitration clauses. Since 90% of trade secret issues are between an employer and an insider, arbitration likely reduces litigation incidents.

Professors Seaman and Levine completed a comprehensive empirical study of DTSA litigation reviewing the statute’s first year.<sup>182</sup> The study reviewed 486 cases that raised a DTSA claim between May 11, 2016 and May 11, 2017.<sup>183</sup> 29% of DTSA claims arose from major technology and corporate hubs (Chicago, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, and New York City); however, DTSA claims were well-distributed across district courts (74% of courts had at least one DTSA claim).<sup>184</sup> The study drew an interesting comparison to a patent case study from 2016 that found patent litigation concentrated in two district courts— Eastern District of Texas and Delaware; these patent-heavy districts handled only 3% of DTSA litigation.<sup>185</sup> The study suggested DTSA expanded plaintiff’s access to federal courts;<sup>186</sup> 78% of cases asserted supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims.<sup>187</sup> 45% of plaintiffs alleged additional federal claims<sup>188</sup> and “nearly all cases with a DTSA claim also asserted one or more related state law causes of action.” <sup>189</sup> Not surprisingly, “the most frequently raised state law claim was trade secret misappropriation.” <sup>190</sup> Notably though, contract-related claims frequently accompanied a DTSA allegation.<sup>191</sup> The frequency of these contract claims suggests trade secret misappropriation commonly happens in context of an insider or sharing agreement, either between two firms or between an employer and employee.

The type of trade secret at-issue confirms this insider context. Plaintiffs alleged misappropriation of their customer and business information (i.e. marketing, financials, customer lists, etc.) far more frequently than secret formulas or software algorithms.<sup>192</sup> Although plaintiffs alleged “technical information” misappropriation fairly frequently (40%),<sup>193</sup> the data suggests that there are far fewer instances of America’s “innovations” being disputed in court. In fact, the study confirms that historical trade secret litigation trends merely continued after DTSA. “Approximately two-thirds of all DTSA disputes involve a current or former employee of the alleged trade secret owner . . . [and] 26% involve a current or former business partner . . .. Only 10% of DTSA claims (50 cases) involve parties who lack a prior relationship.” <sup>194</sup> In fact, “72% of all DTSA claims” assert the defendant is subject to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).<sup>195</sup> NDAs are frequently used to create a contractual obligation to protect confidential information.

Only 9% of DTSA cases alleged any form of cyber espionage,<sup>196</sup> and even fewer (6%) alleged misappropriation from a foreign entity.<sup>197</sup> Although Congress passed the DTSA amidst the “greatest transfer of wealth in history” from American businesses to foreign entities,<sup>198</sup> it seems clear the DTSA is not used for this purpose.

### I. A SNAPSHOT OF DTSA CASE LAW
At the time of this writing, seven appellate circuits cited the Defend Trade Secrets Act, but none of the opinions contribute to the statute’s substantive provisions, and none address how to apply the statute’s provisions when in conflict with state law.<sup>199</sup>

District court case law validates the preemption criticism DTSA received. District courts followed Congress’s intent for the DTSA to co-exist with state law;<sup>200</sup> however, by doing so, the court reduced the DTSA into an amorphous being that takes a different shape depending on the context of the case at-hand. The following case demonstrates DTSA’s nebulous nature.

#### *1. In re Patriot National Inc.*
In re Patriot is a prime example of how the DTSA fails to harmonize trade secret law.<sup>201</sup>  Corporate Claims Management, Inc. (CCMI) provided insurance claims administration and risk management services for its clients.<sup>202</sup> CCMI employed Michelle Shaiper as their Chief Operations Officer. <sup>203</sup> In her role, Shaiper was privy to confidential business information.<sup>204</sup> CCMI required her to sign an employment agreement promising “not to engage in any interfering activities during her employment.” <sup>205</sup> In January 2018, Shaiper began working for a different insurance firm, Brentwood, after tendering her resignation the month before.<sup>206</sup> CCMI filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 30, 2018, and initiated claims for trade secret violations against Shaiper and Brentwood shortly thereafter.<sup>207</sup> CCMI alleged that Shaiper hired several former CCMI employees and that those employees brought CCMI customers with them. <sup>208</sup> Those customers generated “approximately $3.4 million” in revenue.<sup>209</sup> CCMI alleged trade secret misappropriation under three statutes: “the Missouri Uniform Trade Secrets Act (MUTSA), the Florida Uniform Trade Secrets Act (FUTSA), and the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA).”<sup>210</sup>

CCMI alleged misappropriation for seven types of information, which the court separated into two categories: customer list allegations and non-customer list allegations.<sup>211</sup> Missouri law does not recognize customer lists as trade secrets; therefore, the court dismissed misappropriation allegations for that category of information, but maintained the allegations for the others.<sup>212</sup> As to the Florida trade secret allegations, the court determined “[t]he only connection to Florida law in this case is the [Employee Agreement] signed by Shaiper . . . which states that Florida law will govern any disputes . . . .”<sup>213</sup> The court maintained the Florida trade secret allegations against Shaiper, but dismissed the allegations against Shaiper’s new employer because Brentwood was not a party to the employee agreement.<sup>214</sup> Finally, the court addressed the DTSA allegations:

> As the DTSA is to conform with state trade secret laws and not alter specific court decisions, the Court will mirror its rulings under the MUTSA and FUTSA. Therefore, the claims against Brentwood survive the motion for the Non-Customer List Materials (as they did under the MUTSA); and the claims against Shaiper survive the motion in their entirety (as they did under the FUTSA).<sup>215</sup>

The court applied the DTSA *differently against different defendants in the same action.* DTSA merely increased the defendant’s liability. DTSA has no shape. What happens when courts are faced with a standalone DTSA claim? In the end, defendants are left unsure what liability they face when they leave a company.

The complexity showcased by In re Patriot shows that trade secret litigation costs will only increase as well. Courts and litigants must remain vigilant about what standards apply to specific claims. Increased complexity leads to increased costs and liability; defendants have little incentive to go beyond the motion to dismiss stage.

### J. PROPOSED DTSA AMENDMENT IN THE SENATE

Senator Kamala Harris proposed an amendment to the Defend Trade Secrets Act, referred to as the “Deterring Espionage by Foreign Entities through National Defense Act of 2019” (the DEFEND Act).<sup>216</sup> The amendment extends DTSA’s statute of limitations to five years and grants treble damages for trade secrets willfully misappropriated.<sup>217</sup> The amendment also seeks to make it easier to enjoin trade secret misappropriation conduct that occurs outside of the United States by including the provision “the offense causes substantial economic harm in the United States.” <sup>218</sup> As of now, no amendment addresses DTSA’s primary criticisms—preemption and *ex parte* seizure.

## III. ANALYSIS
Congress must repeal the Defend Trade Secrets Act. Trade secret law unsuccessfully attempts to protect the secret itself. The trade secret owner is in the best position to prevent their secret from disclosure. Not Congress. Not the court.

Importantly, this Note does not advocate for abolishing trade secret protection altogether and does not view patent protection, by itself, as sufficient. “A more important consideration is that the patent route, because of its cost and required disclosures, often just is not attractive to an inventor of a patentable invention, so that to abolish or curtail trade secrecy would undermine incentives to innovate.” <sup>219</sup> Applied correctly, trade secret law and patent law work together to encourage innovation and provide for appropriate protection.

Instead, this Note argues for a creative alternative where the federal government focuses on *actual* trade secret misappropriation, specifically those actions that harm the competitive marketplace. The DTSA, as used by trade secret owners and applied by the courts, stifles innovation and competition. Trade secret owners must accept more responsibility and accountability to protect their own secrets.

Trade secret disputes generally arise under three situations: “competitive intelligence, business transactions, and departing employees.” <sup>220</sup> As the subsequent sections show, only competitive intelligence disputes invoke a federal interest because those claims potentially include actions that unfairly harm competition and disincentivize innovation.

### A. SITUATION ONE: BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS

Business transaction disputes do not invoke a federal interest. In the context of a joint venture, or other agreement where parties agree to share trade secrets, the contracting parties are in the best position to assess the impact that would result from the other party misappropriating their trade secret. A trade secret owner is in the best position to judge the risk, and reward, of trusting another party with their trade secret knowledge.

### B. SITUATION TWO: DEPARTING EMPLOYEES

#### *1. Non-Compete Agreements*

Skilled employees suffer the most from trade secret law. Employers control former employees through non-compete agreements and injunctive relief. Noncompete agreements preclude an employee from future employment with a competitor, at least for a certain period of time and usually within a certain geographic distance from the original employer.<sup>221</sup> Both methods— noncompete agreements and injunctive relief —are justified on the grounds that an employee retains their former employer’s trade secret knowledge and will presumably use those secrets in their next venture.

> Employees’ covenants not to compete with their former employer for a period of years are an important method of protecting trade secrets, because it is easier to detect and prove a violation of such a covenant than it is to discover and prove that a competitor’s discovery of one’s trade secret is the result of unlawful appropriation rather than of independent research.<sup>222</sup>

Although non-compete agreements promote judicial economy, their enforcement is based entirely on the contract and asks nothing about the secret that is actually being protected, or whether the secret exists. Non-compete agreements operate under the guise of protecting an employer’s trade secrets, but these agreements also restrict employee know-how. Trade secret law authorizes competitors to reverse engineer inventions as an explicitly proper method of uncovering a trade secret. How is reverse engineering different from competing for the labor that produced the product?

One of the benefits of allowing reverse engineering is the second inventor may use the discovered trade secret in a new innovative way instead of merely duplicating an existing product.<sup>223</sup> “To forbid reverse engineering would inhibit the development of products that do not even compete with the one that has been reverse engineered.” <sup>224</sup> Why is independent research and reverse engineering deemed “proper,” but hiring the skilled employees needed to accomplish this feat forbidden?

There is growing bipartisan support in Congress for eliminating non-compete agreements.<sup>225</sup> Non-compete agreements reduce employee mobility (including employees who wish to start their own business), stifles competition for skilled labor, and limits employee leverage negotiating for better conditions or higher wages.<sup>226</sup> “The combination of expanding trade-secret law and the growing use of employment contracts covering post-employment activity has a huge impact on the career trajectories of many workers.” <sup>227</sup> Non-compete agreements disincentivize skilled workers to develop new skills and expand their knowledge because their post-employment prospects are so limited.<sup>228</sup> Studies show that “managers earn less and they receive incentive compensation less often in states with non-compete enforcements, all else equal. Other researchers found a similar effect in states that provide employers stronger controls via trade-secret law.” <sup>229</sup>

> [W]hen employers control not only true trade secrets but also general employee knowledge and skills, the net effect is it reduces investment and innovation. [Studies] found that states that allow employers to enforce noncompete agreements actually invest less per employee. And economists . . . found that in these states, venture capital investments generate fewer patents, fewer new firms, and less job growth.<sup>230</sup>

Additionally, not only do employees struggle finding a job after leaving a firm, but start-up firms struggle hiring talent in states that enforce non-compete agreements.<sup>231</sup>

Trade secret law protects actual and *potential* trade secret misappropriation;<sup>232</sup> thus, employers seeking injunctive relief under trade secret law are the functional equivalent to employers that use non-compete agreements. Congress’s potential legislation against non-compete agreements is non-sensical considering the way employers use, and the courts enforce, the Defend Trade Secrets Act. If noncompete agreements are foreclosed, Congress provides employers with federal court access to seek injunctive relief instead, via the DTSA.<sup>233</sup>

#### *2. Protecting Competition for Labor and Business*
States compete directly with each other for new business and labor. For example, Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri bitterly compete against one another for new business; so much so that Missouri introduced legislation, at least twice, offering a truce with Kansas to put the fierce competition to rest.<sup>234</sup> Trade secret laws play a role in state competition.

“[E]vidence shows that states that enforce noncompete agreements experience something of a ‘brain drain.’ . . . [I]nventors tend to migrate to states that do not allow employers to enforce noncompete agreements.” <sup>235</sup> Additionally, employee mobility improves innovation as “illustrated by the phenomenal success of Silicon Valley,” where California does not enforce non-compete agreements.<sup>236</sup>

> Silicon Valley employees move around more . . . no doubt often taking some of their previous employers’ trade secrets with them. The resulting pooling of knowledge may . . . contribute more to technological progress than the greater internalization of new technological ideas that a more effective scheme for the protection trade secrets would contribute. . . .”<sup>237</sup>

The movement of employee know-how between firms promotes new knowledge at each stop, and promotes innovation upon existing technologies. More importantly, employers are incentivized to foster a healthy work environment with competitive wages, and even encourage employees to seek additional training, education, or joint ventures that increase employee know-how and satisfaction. Instead of companies swapping trade secrets themselves, perhaps joint ventures that intermingle employees are more efficient. “The informal pooling that comes from the unenforceability of employee covenants not to compete may be on balance more efficient [than cross-licensing technologies].” <sup>238</sup> Even though this Note primarily argues that non-compete agreements should be abandoned completely, there is some justification for their existence. For example, variable state trade secret laws could fuel competition for new talent and new businesses amongst the states.

### C. SITUATION THREE: COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

Congress should also consider its own cost-benefit analysis. “Consider by way of analogy the distinction in international law between lawful and unlawful espionage . . . .”<sup>239</sup> Lawful espionage is illustrated by a nation, “ferret[ing] out another nation’s secrets by patient collation of its published statistics and its newspaper articles.” <sup>240</sup> On the other hand, “unlawful [espionage] is illustrated by bribery . . . , by extortion, by kidnapping . . . in other words, by common law offenses. In part the legal difference is due to the greater cost of preventing espionage of the first kind.” <sup>241</sup> Non-compete agreements, discussed in the preceding section, do not distinguish between “lawful” or “unlawful” espionage. Instead, enforcement is based entirely in contract law, which fails to ask pertinent questions about the actual trade secret that is being protected. Instead, noncompete agreements operate under the assumption that trade secret misappropriation will happen. This assumption, as well as the failure to inquire about the secret that is being protected, harms innovation and technological progress.

Nonetheless, Congress should be concerned with the unlawful tactics used to gain a competitive advantage, because that inhibits a competitive process and competitive marketplace. Much like international law that tolerates lawful espionage, Congress should abandon all issues related to employee mobility and dedicate its resources only to those unlawful tactics.

#### *1. Trade Secret Law Incentivizes the Wrong Behavior*
Trade secret law requires trade secret owners to take reasonable steps to protect its secret, a shifting standard that is determined based on the value of the secret and the situation at hand.<sup>242</sup> Judge Posner described the significance of the precautions trade secret owners use to protect their secrets in *Rockwell Graphic Systems, Inc. v. DEV Industries, Inc*. <sup>243</sup> “The greater the precautions that [the trade secret owner] took to maintain the secrecy of [their secret] . . . the higher the probability that [the alleged thief] obtained [the secret] through a wrongful act; the owner had taken pains to prevent them from being obtained otherwise.” <sup>244</sup> Alternatively, a trade secret “cannot have been worth much if [the owner] did not think it worthwhile to make serious efforts to keep the information secret.” <sup>245</sup>

However, we want trade secret owners to “take *some* precautions, but not too many.” <sup>246</sup> Precautions are not costless, and “perfect security is not optimum security. . . . If trade secrets are protected only if their owners take extravagant, productivity-impairing measures to maintain their secrecy, the incentive to invest resources in discovering more efficient methods of production will be reduced, and with it the amount of invention.” <sup>247</sup> According to Landes and Posner,

<sup>242</sup> *See Rockwell Graphic Systems, Inc. v. DEV Industries, Inc.,* 925 F. 2d 174, 179 (7th Cir. 1991) (“But only in an extreme case can what is a ‘reasonable’ precaution be determined on a motion for summary judgment, because the answer depends on a balancing of costs and benefits that will vary from case to case and so require estimation and measurement by persons knowledgeable in the particular field of endeavor.”).

> Even without a law against the outright theft of trade secrets . . . a firm could do a lot to reduce the probability of such thefts . . . by screening employees . . . [and] installing more effective security systems. *It will do less if the threat of legal sanctions deters the theft of its trade secrets*.<sup>248</sup>

The DTSA incentivizes trade secret owners to do less to protect their secrets. As this Note discussed previously, defendants faced increased liability, and increased costs, from trade secret litigation after the DTSA passed. With increased costs, defendants are less likely to challenge litigation from trade secret owners. Because of this, trade secret owners are in good position to secure injunctive relief without the need to defend the security measures taken to protect the secret at-issue, or if a legally recognized trade secret even exists. Trade secret owners enjoy the protection of a safety net that fails to incentivize them to protect their own secrets.

##### *a. “Break the woks and sink the boats”*
Nevertheless, trade secret owners are properly incentivized without a federal safety net. After crossing a river into enemy territory, a Chinese commander ordered his troops to set fire to their own boats and woks. The Chinese army would defeat the enemy, or they would die. There was no other option. Congress should follow this tactic. Trade secret owners are in the best position to prevent disclosure of a secret in accordance with the value of the secret. The law needs to hold trade secret owners accountable for that burden.

Critics may express concerns that employees will not be properly deterred from stealing their employer’s trade secrets. However, a 1998 Israeli study that documented how often parents were late picking up their children from day care provides some evidence that should mitigate those concerns.<sup>249</sup> Before the study began, parents were rarely late picking up their children, and were not fined the few times they were.<sup>250</sup> After some time, researchers began imposing fines for late pick-ups; at which point, the study noted a dramatic increase in late pickups.<sup>251</sup> By placing a monetary value on being late, parents could complete a costbenefit analysis and determine if being late was worth the fine.<sup>252</sup> In other words, before a fine was imposed, parents felt guilty requiring daycare workers to stay past closing.<sup>253</sup> The study showed how a system built on non-monetary incentives could be more effective than imposing a fine.<sup>254</sup> Similarly, employers can properly incentivize their employees without threatening litigation and limiting their future employment opportunities. Instead, investing in their employees can produce the non-monetary incentives similar to those shown in the Israeli project.

Before the DTSA was passed, an Eli Lilly representative noted that sometimes departing employees would download Lilly trade secrets before they left.<sup>255</sup> That action should be condemned, but be mindful that the value of those secrets are unknown, and whether the employee should even have access to those secrets is unknown. If the goal is to prevent disclosure of secrets in the first instance, Eli Lilly is in the best position to do that, and that is where the government should motivate Eli Lilly to strengthen its own internal policies. Instead of providing a safety net in case an employee might disclose a secret, the government should focus on instances where Eli Lilly alleges actual misappropriation, such as the example Eli Lilly provided in their comment to Congress.<sup>256</sup>

Sink the boats. Break the woks. Invest in your employees. What likely remains is intentionally wrongful conduct that the government can comfortably condemn because it likely harms innovation and competition.

#### *2. Federal Interest Properly Lies in Improper Conduct*
“[F]ocusing exclusively on protecting perceived trade secret rights misses the point that what we really care about is preventing certain behaviors that are deemed wrongful . . . .”<sup>257</sup>The United States seeks to promote innovation and competition. As discussed previously, competition amongst the states is promoted by avoiding a federal trade secret law; however, Congress is rightfully concerned with trade secret theft when it rises to the level of unfair competition. Although Congress is in a poor position to prevent theft, the government could punish conduct that results in actual theft, or harms the competitive marketplace.

Congress has battled unfair competitive behavior in the marketplace for over a century. The Sherman Act, enacted in 1890, bars conspiracies and combinations that restrain trade, as well as unlawful attempts to monopolize or maintain a monopoly.<sup>258</sup> In 1914, Congress followed up the Sherman Act with the Clayton Act (generally, precluding stock or company acquisitions that produce anticompetitive effects),<sup>259</sup> and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act.<sup>260</sup> As its name implies, the FTC Act established the Federal Trade Commission as an independent agency.<sup>261</sup> The FTC Act declares “[u]nfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce” unlawful.<sup>262</sup> Furthermore, the FTC Act empowers the Commission “to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations . . . from using unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” <sup>263</sup>

Competitive intelligence cases normally involve an independent wrong.<sup>264</sup> Competitive intelligence gained from these tactics easily constitutes unfair methods of competition that align particularly well with the Federal Trade Commission’s current mission. Both Congress and the Supreme Court empower the FTC to establish what constitutes unfair competition. As the Supreme Court noted, Congress “explicitly considered, and rejected, the notion that it reduces the ambiguity of the phrase ‘unfair methods of competition’. . .. It is impossible to frame definitions which embrace all unfair practices. There is no limit to human inventiveness in this field.” <sup>265</sup>

Thus, the Supreme Court grants the FTC considerable discretion “in measuring a practice against the elusive, but congressionally mandated standard of fairness.” <sup>266</sup> The Supreme Court adopted the factors the FTC considers when determining if an act is unfair, including “whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous,” and “whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen).” <sup>267</sup> Finally, the Commission’s experience using permanent injunctions and equitable monetary relief to restore competitive balance is critical in this context.<sup>268</sup>

However, simply giving this mission to the FTC will not save the United States from trade secret theft. Aside from the persistent concern of scarce government resources, the Commission is limited to enforcing unfair methods of competition against foreign nations only when certain criteria are met<sup>269</sup> and lacks expertise combatting espionage or cyber espionage. Industrial espionage encompasses a diverse range of bad actors that could be domestic or foreign, private or national. Combatting this diverse threat requires creative applications of the government’s expertise. Perhaps, the government should consider a joint venture between the FTC and other government agencies, such as the National Security Agency who could bring cybersecurity expertise. A government joint venture can act proactively to train businesses on proper security measures and publish best practices related to trade secret protection and policies.

Whatever Congress molds as the solution, repealing the Defend Trade Secrets Act is the first step. The DTSA harms innovation while doing nothing to stem the $600 billion tide of stolen secrets<sup>270</sup> leaving the country. Although government resources are always a concern, the sheer vastness of this problem warrants significant investment.

## IV. CONCLUSION
Congress must repeal the Defend Trade Secrets Act. The DTSA unnecessarily adds complexity to trade secret litigation, gives plaintiffs an overwhelming litigation advantage, and fails to effectively protect trade secrets. Congress sought to structure the DTSA so that it co-existed alongside state trade secret law, but by doing so the DTSA merely adds complexity to litigation and fails to harmonize state law variations. Additionally, amending DTSA to preempt state law negatively impacts state-level competition for business and labor.

Neither Congress nor the courts are in the best position to prevent trade secret disclosure. Trade secret owners bear this burden. Instead, Congress should focus on *actual* trade secret misappropriation through unfair competitive conduct. The majority of trade secret litigation affected business “insiders” and disputes over customer information or business strategy information. Although business owners find this information extremely valuable to protect their local market share, this is hardly the innovative technical information that Congress believes gives the United States a competitive advantage.

Variations in state laws reflect very different attitudes towards trade secrets and how best to protect them. At the federal level, Congress has a legitimate interest in maintaining a fair, competitive marketplace; thus, trade secrets stolen through cyber theft or other industrial espionage tactics fall within Congress’s concern. Trade secret law fails to combat these wrongs.
