## V. PUTTING A FILTER ON SPEECH: WHY IT IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY FOR SCHOOLS TO REGULATE OFF-CAMPUS STUDENT CYBERSPEECH

While the outcome of *B.L.* is just, rejecting the *Tinker* exception in offcampus student speech cases raises concerns moving forward.<sup>143</sup> Under a more extreme, nuanced set of facts, this holding may bar schools from regulating cyberspeech that materially and substantially disrupts the school environment and is harmful to students—solely because it happened off campus.<sup>144</sup> In order to conform with the *Tinker*’s intent and progeny to maintain a safe school environment, the Fourth Circuit’s sufficient nexus test offers a solution to the issue that conforms with *Tinker*. <sup>145</sup>

### A. *Giving Tinker a Much-Needed Update: Why Supreme Court Precedent Supports Extending the Tinker Exception to Off-Campus Cyberspeech*

To maintain a safe school environment, the Fourth Circuit’s sufficient nexus test provides the best analytical framework.<sup>146</sup> Although the Supreme Court has made clear that students retain their First Amendment rights in school, *Tinker* and its progeny also place a limit on those rights.<sup>147</sup> In those cases, the Supreme Court recognized that under some circumstances, it is appropriate for schools to regulate student speech.<sup>148</sup>

***
<sup>143</sup>. *See id.* at 195 (explaining that the majority provided no guidance regarding how to apply its holding in future cases and that “there are no facts before [the court] to draw a clear and administrable line for this new rule”).

<sup>144</sup>. *See* Marcus-Toll, *supra* note 59, at 3419 (arguing limiting school authority over speech that only occurs on campus is illogical given the nature and reach of technology).

<sup>145</sup>. *See* Jiles, *supra* note 60, at 662–63 (asserting “sufficient nexus test is the most adequate test to use in balancing the student’s privacy interests guaranteed Tinker and the interest of the school district in deterring any future disruptions on campus”). 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>146</sup>. *See* Smith-Butler, *supra* note 13, at 301–02 (“A literal reading of *Tinker* reflects that schools can regulate or discipline student speech that occurs off-campus if it has an on-campus impact that either causes a substantial disruption with the school’s work, is reasonably foreseeable that it will cause a substantial disruption with the school’s work, or it collides with the rights of others.”).

<sup>147</sup>. *See* Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 408 (2007) (finding schools may regulate student speech promoting illegal drug use given that it conflicts with schools’ goal of discouraging illegal drug use); Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 271 (1988) (noting that school officials may regulate expression associated with academic curriculum in order to tailor it to the maturity of students); Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 683 (1986) (determining it appropriate for a school district to regulate vulgar student expression); Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 511 (1969) (holding a school may regulate student speech if the speech creates material and substantial disruption). 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>148</sup>. *See Fraser,* 478 U.S. at 682 (explaining First Amendment rights of public school students are not the same as rights of adults). Additionally, this demonstrates that since *Tinker*, the Supreme Court has been comfortable with adding additional restrictions to student’s First Amendment rights given the facts of the situation. *See* Shaver, *supra* note 28, at 1582. Thus, as our society continues to change, it is possible that the Court would be comfortable adding another exception to student speech rights. *See id.*

In *Frase*r, for example, Justice Burger noted that “simply because the use of an offensive form of expression may not be prohibited to adults making what the speaker considers a political point, [it does not follow that] the same latitude must be permitted for children in public school.”<sup>149</sup>

*Tinker* should evolve with the times by extending to off-campus speech because its exceptions promote a safe and orderly environment in school.<sup>150</sup> If speech impedes on the rights of other students, while simultaneously disrupting normal school activity, schools can regulate speech.<sup>151</sup> This comports with the Supreme Court’s recognition that students have more limited First Amendment rights while in school.<sup>152</sup> But those cases dealt with issues of school-sponsored speech and did not consider the future impact of electronic communication and the prevalence of social media.<sup>153</sup> As compared to fifty years ago, the rise of electronic communication has led to less emphasis on where the speech occurs; separating off-campus speech from on-campus speech is no longer clear.<sup>154</sup> Online communication is constant, readily accessible, permanent, and quickly circulated.<sup>155</sup> The fast-paced, widespread nature of social media speech enters and impacts the school environment even more easily than traditional forms of expression.<sup>156</sup> Thus, to preserve the intent behind

*Tinker* and ensure a safe, secure school environment, the *Tinker* exception must apply to off-campus student social media speech.<sup>157</sup>

Despite the difficulty in drawing a distinction between on- and offcampus speech, there remains a compelling argument that student social media speech falls within the school’s authority.<sup>158</sup> The Supreme Court in *Tinker* noted:

[C]onduct by the student, in class or *out of it,* which for any reason—whether it stems from time, place, or type of behavior— materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.<sup>159</sup>

While schools must respect students’ First Amendment rights, they also must have the ability to address off-campus cyberbullying that causes a substantial disruption in the school building or impedes a student’s right to school safety.<sup>160</sup>

is often felt there. *See* Caralee Adams, *Cyberbullying: What Teachers and Schools Can Do,* SCHOLASTIC, https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/ cyberbullying-what-teachers-and-schools-can-do/ [https://perma.cc/FC6B-Y67Z] (last visited Sept. 29, 2020) (explaining that even though cyberbullying often occurs off campus, “the fallout is often seen at school and can interfere with the educational environment”). Nancy Willard, Director of the Center for Safe and Responsible Internet Use, explained that “Monday is the new Friday . . . . It used to be that hurtful interactions built up over the week and could blow up on Friday. Now when kids go back to school on Monday, they are upset because of what happened over the weekend.” *Id.* (internal quotation marks omitted). 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>157</sup>. *See* Shaver, *supra* note 28, at 1589–90 (recognizing that although Tinker was decided before digital age, its intent to protect students from “bullying or harassing speech” extends to cyberspeech). 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>158</sup>. *See* McDonald, *supra* note 156, at 745 (explaining that student cyberbullying typically arises from school relationships). In all likelihood, physical off-campus bullying does not fall within the school’s authority. *Id.* What distinguishes off campus cyberbullying from off campus physical bullying is that “cyberspace knows no geographic boundaries . . . . [It] has an ‘everywhere’ and ‘all the time’ quality which bullying that occurs in the physical world generally lacks.” *Id.* at 746. Additionally, because cyberbullying can occur anonymously, a bully is more likely to be even harsher than they would be face-to-face. *See* Jiles, *supra* note 60, at 646.

<sup>159</sup>. Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 513 (1969) (emphasis added) (reading the Constitution to allow regulation of “speech-connected activities in carefully restricted circumstances”). While the “substantial disruption” test often gets significant attention from courts, the “collides with the rights of others” portion is key, as it can assist school officials when they are in situations where the speech is troubling but does not rise to the level of a substantial disruption. *See* Smith-Butler, *supra* note 13, at 302. Speech that is troubling— yet may not rise to the substantial disruption standard—could be speech that is “bullying, harassing, libelous, or threatening” or has to do with “cruelty, racism, sexism.” *Id.* at 302, 303. 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>160</sup>. *See* Smith-Butler, *supra* note 13, at 303 (“Schools want to protect student political speech rights yet also allow schools the flexibility to cope with cruelty, racism, sexism, libel, or threats that other types of student speech create.”); *see also* Adams, *supra* note 156 (explaining that cyberbullying is now a “school climate and safety issue”).
{: .fs-2}

Furthermore, the geographical origin of the cyberspeech means means much less today than it did when the Supreme Court decided *Tinker*. <sup>161</sup> Thus, the majority in *B.L.* may have focused too much on location rather than the speech’s effects within the school community.<sup>162</sup> Now, students can constantly contact one another while off campus.<sup>163</sup> The majority of contacts students make are with their peers.<sup>164</sup> In all likelihood, these students follow one another on social media, based on their preexisting relationships from school.<sup>165</sup> What a student posts, messages, or shares online can be viewed or commented on by their peers, extending their interactions beyond the school building.<sup>166</sup> For these reasons, online content easily makes its way into the school building through students who virtually bring it through the school’s doors.<sup>167</sup> Forcing schools to abide by the strict geographic location of where the speech began seems immaterial when the speech significantly impacts the school’s most important group: the students.<sup>168</sup>

### B. *Tinker is a Must Follow: Public Policy Supports Applying the Exception in Cases of Off-Campus Social Media Speech*

In addition to Supreme Court precedent, public policy supports extending the *Tinker* exception to off-campus social media speech. In *B.L*., the Third Circuit logically found that B.L.’s speech was protected because the snap did not cause harm to anyone.169 Even if the court applied the *Tinker* exception to the case, it is likely that the First Amendment would have still protected B.L.’s speech because it did not create the requisite

“substantial disruption.”<sup>170</sup> The Third Circuit’s majority opinion is concerning not because it chose to protect B.L.’s speech, but rather because of the precedent it sets for future cases, where the cyberspeech is more vulgar or violent.<sup>171</sup>

School officials have a legitimate interest in regulating certain kinds of off-campus online speech for two reasons.<sup>172</sup> First, schools do not merely teach students subjects like math, history, and science.<sup>173</sup> Rather, schools also take on an inherent responsibility to teach social etiquette.<sup>174</sup> To show students how to appropriately engage and communicate with others, it is important for school officials to be able to regulate inappropriate forms of cyberspeech.<sup>175</sup> Doing so sets an example for students by signifying that the school neither tolerates nor ignores inappropriate or harmful speech.<sup>176</sup>

Second, cyberbullying and hate speech have a severe impact on students’ mental health and the school environment.<sup>177</sup> Whether the speech occurred in person, at school, or online over social media should not be relevant when the ultimate impact is on the student and their educational experience.<sup>178</sup> If schools stand by and say nothing when a student is bullied online, then the bully is less likely to stop, and will continue to subject the victim to this negative behavior.<sup>179</sup> Furthermore, a student might feel distracted in school, or avoid school completely, after being bullied online by peers.<sup>180</sup> While schools must demonstrate respect for students’ First Amendment rights, they also must maintain an appropriate and comfortable environment for students.<sup>181</sup> The characteristics of the school environment permit a school to regulate off-campus social media behavior that causes harm to others.<sup>182</sup>

### C. *Precedent and Policy Support Subscribing to the Sufficient Nexus Test*
Overall, the Fourth Circuit’s sufficient nexus test best conforms with Supreme Court precedent and public policy.<sup>183</sup> This test strikes an appropriate balance between students’ First Amendment rights and the necessity of maintaining an appropriate, safe school environment.<sup>184</sup> Speech such as B.L.’s snap would remain protected, while schools would be permitted to regulate more dangerous forms of cyberspeech.<sup>185</sup>

The sufficient nexus test strikes a balance between First Amendment concerns and protecting student well-being because it considers the school’s task to educate, the mental health of students, and whether the speech will cause a substantial disruption in the school.<sup>186</sup> If these factors demonstrate that the cyberspeech is sufficiently connected to these three interests for schools, the *Tinker* exception will apply and allow the school to intervene if the speech is likely to create a substantial disruption.<sup>187</sup> Importantly, the test does not consider where the speech originated, avoiding the impossible task of determining whether the electronic speech occurred on or off campus.<sup>188</sup>

Although the majority in *B.L.* declined to apply the sufficient nexus test, its reasons for failing to do so are unpersuasive.<sup>189</sup> The majority’s

first reason for rejection was its concerns over a slippery slope, allowing schools to regulate other less threatening kinds of online speech.<sup>190</sup> But the sufficient nexus test does not give schools an infinite ability to punish students for any kind of speech.<sup>191</sup> Before a school regulates student speech, the test requires that the school to establish a legitimate connection between the speech and school’s interest in providing an appropriate learning environment.<sup>192</sup> Also, under the Tinker exception, a school must demonstrate the likelihood that the speech would create a substantial disruption in the school.<sup>193</sup>

The majority in *B.L.* also rejected the sufficient nexus test because it felt that the test placed too much speech within the school’s authority.<sup>194</sup> It is true that this test gives a school significant authority over speech.<sup>195</sup> However, a major part of a school’s role is to maintain a safe learning environment for students.<sup>196</sup> When one student is making another student feel uncomfortable or unsafe, school officials are in one of the best positions to resolve the problem.<sup>197</sup>

Finally, the majority opinion was concerned that the sufficient nexus test fails to provide clarity or predictability in future outcomes.<sup>198</sup> While the sufficient nexus test may not provide a bright-line rule, that is the na-

By requiring schools to establish this relationship before moving to the Tinker analysis, this step adds an additional burden on schools and ensures they do not have limitless authority. *See* Jiles, *supra* note 60, at 666. It imposes a strict standard that ensures schools are not able to regulate* any* speech that is related to the school and just speech that is “so related to the pedagogical interest of the school, to warrant regulation.” *Id.* at 666.

ture of the issue at hand.<sup>199</sup>These cases are fact-dependent, and it is counterintuitive to have a clear and rigid rule.<sup>200</sup> Regardless, it is unlikely students will not understand what speech is protected versus what speech is punishable.<sup>201</sup> Thus, the sufficient nexus test provides a flexible approach for complex fact patterns. 

Additionally, the majority did not explain how declining to apply the *Tinker* exception in any circumstance created more clarity than the sufficient nexus test.<sup>202</sup> The opinion tells us that schools can never intervene but fails to address what should happen under a set of facts which are less clear-cut than those in *B.L.*<sup>203</sup> A blanket statement that the *Tinker* exception does not extend to off-campus cyberspeech creates more confusion than the sufficient nexus test because it does not allow courts and schools to act logically and flexibly based on the circumstances.<sup>204</sup>

<sup>201</sup>. *See* Jiles, *supra* note 60, at 666 (explaining under sufficient nexus test, cyberbullying between students almost certainly falls under school’s authority). For instance, posting online about religious or political beliefs will generally fall under protected speech given that it does not target other students. *See* Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 509 (1969) (explaining that in order to regulate student speech, school officials “must be able to show . . . more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint”). Alternatively, given that cyberbullying directly impacts the victim’s academic experience, that speech will typically fall within the school’s discretion. *See* Jiles, *supra *note 60, at 666–67.

<sup>203</sup>. *See id. *at 195 (noting majority provides no guidance regarding how the decision will apply to future cases where off-campus cyberspeech threatens or harasses others in school community). The majority recognized that it is not facing a case where the off-campus speech directly harassed or threatened students or teachers. *See id.* at 190. Still, it disagreed with courts that have applied the *Tinker* exception to instances of threatening or harassing off-campus cyberspeech. *Id.* Despite disagreeing, the Third Circuit offered no insight into how its holding in B.L. would apply under those circumstances. *See id.* Instead, the court wrote that the “opinion takes no position on schools’ bottom-line power to discipline speech in that category” and merely acknowledged that its holding diminishes schools’ abilities to regulate some speech.
