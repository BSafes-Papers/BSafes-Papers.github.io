## V. TEXAS PENAL CODE SECTION 21.19 FILLS THE GAP FOR DIGITAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT

### A. *Texas Penal Code Section 21.19 Compared to Texas’s Harassment Law*

#### 1. Texas Penal Code Section 42.07 

Many states have their own harassment laws in which the criteria to prosecute under seems similar to the criteria necessary to prosecute under TPC Section 21.19, including Texas.<sup>240</sup> Texas’s harassment law, Penal

<sup>239</sup>. *See* Closson, *supra* note 22 (quoting Rep. Morgan Meyer, the author of the legislation: “‘We understand that enforcement will be a challenge,’ . . . ‘but this bill is intended to serve as a deterrent as well. It’s keeping people aware that sending unsolicited lewd photos will not be tolerated . . . and stopping them from doing it in the first place’”).

Code Section 42.07, makes it a crime if, “with intent to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, or embarrass another, the person: (1) initiates communication and in the course of the communication makes a comment, request, suggestion, or proposal that is obscene.”<sup>241</sup> This harassment law has similarities but differs from TPC Section 21.19, which criminalizes the simple act of knowingly sending certain sexual visual material without the recipient’s request or express consent.<sup>242</sup>

One could argue TPC Section 21.19 is easier to prosecute under because it is not necessary to prove a certain state of mind for the sender, only that the visual material was not requested nor expressly consented to. This is unlike Texas’s Penal Code Section 42.07, which requires the offender to have had intended to “harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, or embarrass another” when sending it.<sup>243</sup> Under Section 42.07, receiving one piece of the obscene visual material described might not be enough to get a conviction if the sender claims it was to propose a genuine activity.<sup>244</sup> This is different from TPC Section 21.19 because the sender of the visual material can be prosecuted after sending it for the first time, even if the sender was genuine and thought the recipient would appreciate the gesture.<sup>245</sup> The “intent” element in Section 42.07 allows the recipient to press charges against the sender only when the circumstances and evidence prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the “intent” element is indeed met.<sup>246</sup> Intent inherently requires more evidence than the lack of request or express consent of the recipient, which prevents an influx of lawsuits and gives law enforcement more information based on circumstantial and direct evidence provided by the recipient in determining whether the case can be tried in court successfully. 

Section 42.07 also differentiates from TPC Section 21.19 by criminalizing obscene material, defining “obscene” within the statute as “containing a patently offensive description of or a solicitation to commit an ultimate sex act, including sexual intercourse, masturbation, cunnilingus, fellatio, or

course of the communication makes a comment, request, suggestion, or proposal that is obscene.”), *with* PENAL CODE § 21.19 (H.B. 2789) (explicitly excluding an “intent” requirement).

anilingus, or a description of an excretory function.”<sup>247</sup> This definition is far more narrow than what is punishable under TPC Section 21.19.<sup>248</sup> Additionally, there is an “intent” requirement under Section 42.07 and it is one of seven punishable offenses under the Harassment law.<sup>249</sup> Because of this, Section 42.07 is impeded from becoming a significant deterrent and symbol against the normalization of sending unsolicited sexual visual material. Texas Penal Code Section 21.19 is a major symbol and direct stance against indecent online exposure in a time of desperate need.
