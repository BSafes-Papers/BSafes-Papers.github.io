## IV. THE THIRD CIRCUIT HAS ENTERED THE CHAT: A NARRATIVE ANALYSIS ON THE COURT’S REFUSAL TO APPLY TINKER TO OFF-CAMPUS STUDENT CYBERSPEECH

In *B.L. ex rel*. Levy, the Third Circuit’s majority affirmed the district court’s decision that the First Amendment protected B.L.’s speech.<sup>103</sup> In doing so, it rejected approaches taken by other circuits and found that the *Tinker* exception does not apply to any instances of off-campus student speech.<sup>104</sup> Although Judge Ambro agreed with the overarching outcome of the case, he issued a separate concurring opinion to express his concerns with the majority’s broad rejection of the *Tinker* exception.<sup>105</sup>

### A. *Uploading New Content: The Majority in B.L. Takes a Different Approach to Off-Campus Student Cyberspeech*

The School District appealed the district court’s decision to the Third Circuit.<sup>106</sup> The court first had to determine whether B.L.’s snap was protected speech.<sup>107</sup> If the speech was protected, then the court would have to address whether B.L. validly waived that protection by agreeing to the MAHS policies.<sup>108</sup>

The court began by reviewing the Supreme Court’s four main student speech cases: *Tinker, Fraser, Kuhlmeier, and Morse.* <sup>109</sup> Overall, it interpreted these four cases to demonstrate that students have limited First Amendment rights on school grounds, but their rights “are coextensive with [those] of an adult” when off of school grounds.<sup>110</sup> In the Third Circuit’s view, this implied that school officials cannot constitutionally discipline students for their speech that occurs off of school grounds.<sup>111</sup>

In light of this observation, the court then looked to where B.L.’s snap occurred.<sup>112</sup> It noted that Supreme Court cases “focus[ ] not on physical boundaries [of the school] but on the extent to which schools control or sponsor the forum of the speech.”<sup>113</sup> The court acknowledged that at a certain point, the school’s authority comes to an end and cannot “reach into a child’s home and control his/her actions” in the same way that it could control the child’s actions in school.<sup>114</sup> While the court recognized that defining this boundary is a difficult task, it ultimately looked to *J.S*. and *Layshock* for guidance.<sup>115</sup> Based on those cases, the Third Circuit concluded that B.L.’s snap occurred off campus because it was posted while off school grounds on a weekend.<sup>116</sup>

Next, the court assessed the School District’s defense that it could constitutionally suspend B.L. under *Fraser.* <sup>117</sup> The School District argued that it had the power “to enforce socially acceptable behavior” by regulating speech that is “vulgar, lewd, obscene, or plainly offensive.”<sup>118</sup> The Third Circuit rejected this argument because *Fraser* applied specifically to vulgar, lewd, or offensive speech *on campus.* <sup>119</sup> Thus, *Fraser* did not apply because B.L.’s speech took place off campus.<sup>120</sup>

erick, 551 U.S. 393, 400–01, 407 (2007))). The court also mentioned that *Kuhlmeier* found a school’s “editorial authority applies ‘only when a student’s school-sponsored speech could reasonably be viewed as speech of the school itself.’” *Id.* at 178 (quoting Saxe v. State Coll. Area Sch. Dist., 240 F.3d 200, 213–14 (3d. Cir. 2001)).

The Third Circuit noted it previously stated that “[i]t is ‘wellestablished’ that the boundary demarcating schools’ heightened authority to regulate student speech ‘is not constructed solely of the bricks and mortar surrounding the school yard.’” *Id.* at 178 (quoting Layshock *ex rel*. Layshock v. Hermitage Sch. Dist., 650 F.3d 205, 216 (3d Cir. 2011)). 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>114</sup>. *Id.* at 179 (quoting *Layshock*, 650 F.3d at 216). The School District argued that as a member of the cheerleading team, B.L. represented MAHS in a way that is similar to how “government employees represent their employer.” *Id.* at 183 (quoting Brief of Appellant at 30, B.L., 964 F.3d 170 (No. 19-1842)). The Third Circuit rejected both arguments. *See id. *
{: .fs-2}
<sup>115</sup>. *See id.* at 180 (noting that “significant groundwork has been laid”). In both of those cases, the Third Circuit concluded that online student speech is not considered to be on-campus speech even when the communication is shared between students, refers to the school and school faculty, and impacts the school environment. *See id.* For a more detailed discussion of these cases, see *supra* notes 64–71 and accompanying text.

Next, the court addressed the School District’s claim that application of the Tinker exception justified B.L.’s punishment.<sup>121</sup> The court considered three main approaches applied by other circuits: the Second and Eighth Circuit’s reasonable foreseeability test, the Fourth Circuit’s sufficient nexus test, and the Fifth Circuit’s approach.<sup>122</sup> After providing a brief overview of these three approaches, the court outlined criticisms of each.<sup>123</sup> First, the court emphasized that “bad facts make bad law.”<sup>124</sup> It argued that while it makes sense to allow schools to regulate direct threats of violence or posts that target students, it creates a slippery slope that allows for the regulation of other less threatening kinds of online speech.<sup>125</sup> Second, the court felt that these approaches placed too much speech under the authority of the school because of social media’s perva-

*Fraser* to off-campus speech, reasoning that doing so would otherwise allow schools to control expression that was not within their authority to begin with. *See id.* at 183 (citing Layshock *ex rel.* Layshock v. Hermitage Sch. Dist., 650 F.3d 205, 216 (3d Cir. 2011)). 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>121</sup>. *See id.* (addressing School District’s argument that “B.L.’s snap was likely to substantially disrupt the cheerleading program”). Whether the *Tinker* exception could apply to off-campus speech was an issue of first impression and one the Third Circuit had avoided answering in the past. Id. In J.S., the court “assume[d], without deciding” that *Tinker* exception applied to the off-campus speech because the school did not demonstrate that a substantial disruption was foreseeable. Id. at 183–84 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting J.S. *ex rel*. Snyder v. Blue Mountain Sch. Dist., 650 F.3d 915, 926 (3d. Cir. 2011)). Additionally, the court recognized that when it decided *Layshock* and *J.S.*, social media just began gaining popularity, and the *Tinker* exception’s application to electronic speech was a developing issue.* See id.* at 185. But in 2020, the court realized that this issue could no longer be ignored due to “social media[’s] . . . expansion into every corner of modern life.” *Id. *
{: .fs-2}
<sup>122</sup> *See id.* at 185–86. For a more in-depth discussion of the reasonable foreseeability test, the sufficient nexus test, and the Fifth Circuit approach, see Section II.A. 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>123</sup>. *See id.* at 187–89 (rejecting to follow the various approaches taken by its sister circuits). Nevertheless, the Third Circuit stated that it sympathized with the other circuit courts, recognizing the difficulty in navigating students’ off-campus free speech rights in the context of social media. *See id.* 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>124</sup>. *Id.* at 187 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Joseph, 730 F.3d 336, 337 (3d Cir. 2013)). 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>125</sup> *See id.* (noting that “one unmistakable trend from the case law is that the most challenging fact patterns have produced rules untethered from the contexts in which they arose”). To illustrate this point, the court discussed how in *Wisniewski*, the Second Circuit used the reasonable foreseeability test to understandably allow a school to discipline a student who threatened violence. *Id.* However, the Second Circuit later applied the same test to uphold a school’s punishment of a student who falsely claimed in a blog post that a school band contest was canceled. *Id.*

siveness.<sup>126</sup> Third, the court did not think that any of these approaches provided sufficient clarity or predictability.<sup>127</sup>

Overall, the Third Circuit believed that the three tests offer too broad of an approach and alter the meaning of *Tinker*. <sup>128</sup> It decided to instead “forge [its] own path.”<sup>129</sup> Thus, the Third Circuit broadly concluded the *Tinker *exception does not extend to student cyberspeech that occurs outside of school-sponsored activities.<sup>130</sup> Ultimately, it affirmed the district court’s finding that B.L.’s suspension was unconstitutional.<sup>131</sup>

### B. *Snapping Back to the Majority: Judge Ambro’s Concurrence*

Judge Ambro agreed with the overall judgment of the case but dissented from the majority’s finding that the *Tinker* exception does not extend to off-campus cyberspeech, noting the facts currently at issue do not support such a broad-sweeping conclusion.<sup>132</sup> First, Judge Ambro emphasized that the Third Circuit previously declined to limit the *Tinker* exception to on-campus speech.<sup>133</sup> Judge Ambro also noted that no other

<sup>126</sup>. *See id.* at 187–88 (explaining that its sister circuits’ tests are overly broad). Specifically, the court found the reasonable foreseeability test too broad because many students follow one another, and it is inevitable that a student’s “message may automatically pop up on the face of classmates’ phones in the form of notifications from Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or any number of other social platforms.” *Id.* at 187. Additionally, the court said that the sufficient nexus test was overly broad because it blurs the line between on and off campus. *See id.* at 188. The test allows for schools to regulate speech anytime it disrupts the schools’ educational mission, which the court fears is a power that can be abused. *See id. *
{: .fs-2}
<sup>127</sup>. *Id.* (explaining no approach gives students or teachers “clear guidance” (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Longoria Next Friend of M.L. v. San Benito Indep. Consol. Sch. Dist., 942 F.3d 258, 265 (5th Cir. 2019)). The court reasoned that the Fifth Circuit approach provides no definitive test. *See id.* As for the reasonable foreseeability test, the court stated it is difficult to predict how or when off-campus speech will reach on campus. *See id*. Regarding the sufficient nexus test, the court stated that it is unclear to students what types of speech would sufficiently relate to a school’s “pedagogical interests.” *Id*. (quoting Kowalski v. Berkeley Cty. Sch., 652 F. 3d 565, 573 (4th Cir. 2011)).

{: .fs-2}
<sup>130</sup>. *See id*. (noting that this approach abides by *Tinker* and provides school officials and students with clarity). The court did acknowledge that the approach “leaves some vulgar, crude, or offensive speech beyond the power of schools to regulate.” *Id.* at 191. 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>131</sup>. *Id.* at 194. Although the Third Circuit concluded the *Tinker* exception did not apply, if it did, B.L.’s speech likely would have been protected, as it was not reasonably foreseeable the speech would create a substantial disruption in the school. *See id.* at 195 (Ambro, J., concurring).

Additionally, Judge Ambro noted that, in J.S., the Third Circuit assumed *Tinker* applied. *Id.*
{: .fs-2}

circuit court has rendered such a broad conclusion.<sup>134</sup> While other courts have declined to apply *Tinker* to off-campus speech based on certain facts, Judge Ambro stated those same courts later chose to apply *Tinker* outside of the geographical school boundary.<sup>135</sup>

Additionally, Judge Ambro argued that the majority based its s holding on simple facts.<sup>136</sup> While Judge Ambro considered the court’s decision logical based on these facts, he worried about how the decision could lead to confusion when applied to more complicated facts.<sup>137</sup> For example, Judge Ambro noted that it is unclear whether “a school [can] discipline a student who posts off-campus [s]naps reenacting and mocking the victims of police violence where those [s]naps are not related to school . . . yet provoke significant disruptions within the school.”<sup>138</sup>

Finally, Judge Ambro concluded by admonishing the majority’s holding that courts must exercise judicial restraint when deciding cases.<sup>139</sup> According to Judge Ambro, the Third Circuit’s decision was broader than necessary and “anticipate[d] a question of constitutional law in advance.”<sup>140</sup> Judge Ambro emphasized that the majority could have applied the *Tinker* exception to B.L.’s situation and ruled in B.L.’s favor.<sup>141</sup> Thus, it was unnecessary for the majority to go further and analyze whether the *Tinker* exception applies to off-campus student cyberspeech.<sup>142</sup>
