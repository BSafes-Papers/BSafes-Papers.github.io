## VI. TTYL: THE FUTURE OF OFF-CAMPUS STUDENT CYBERSPEECH AND NEED FOR SUPREME COURT GUIDANCE

With conflicting resolutions among schools and courts alike, it is essential that the Supreme Court address this issue.<sup>205</sup>Currently, both school officials and students are uncertain of how to navigate off-campus social media speech.<sup>206</sup> This lack of clarity opens the door for schools to inconsistently target, discipline, or silence specific groups.<sup>207</sup> For example, in an Alabama school district, twelve out of the fourteen students expelled due to social media posts were students of color, despite the fact that over sixty percent of the town’s population is white.<sup>208</sup> If the Supreme Court clarifies the standard for off-campus cyberspeech, this would assist groups like the expelled Alabama students can raise constitutional challenges to schools’ application of speech restrictions. 

Luckily, there is a chance that the Supreme Court could address this issue.<sup>209</sup> On August 28, 2020, the Mahanoy Area School District filed Petition for a writ of certiorari.<sup>210</sup> Given the increasingly important role that the internet and social media play in students’ daily lives, there is hope that the Supreme Court will hear the case.<sup>211</sup> However, in 2016, the de-

The split in the lower courts’ decisions shows that the law is ambiguous.” (footnote omitted)).

<sup>206</sup> *See* Calve, *supra* note 22, at 401 (noting that “[b]ecause ‘lower courts have not spoken with a unified voice’ on the issue of off-campus speech, schools and students are both left without clues as to how to proceed within the law” (footnote omitted) (quoting Martha McCarthy, *Cyberbullying Laws and First Amendment Rulings: Can They Be Reconciled?,* 83 MISS.

fendant in the Fifth Circuit’s *Bell* opinion petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, which was denied.<sup>212</sup>

Until the Court addresses the issue of off-campus cyberspeech speech, schools should tread carefully if punishing students for off-campus cyberspeech in light of the Third Circuit’s holding in *B.L.* Because the Third Circuit concluded the *Tinker* exception does not extend to off-campus electronic speech, it is unlikely that a court in its jurisdiction would uphold intervention.<sup>213</sup> Even school policies prohibiting certain kinds of online speech are virtually unenforceable if the speech occurs off campus and is unrelated to a school-sponsored activity.<sup>214</sup>

Despite the inability to punish students for off-campus cyberspeech, cyberbullying and online harassment are still pressing concerns for schools.<sup>215</sup> While *B.L.* greatly limits how schools can retroactively address social media misuse, schools can at least focus on strengthening preventative measures.<sup>216</sup> For instance, integrating lessons about cyberbullying and its effects into the academic curriculum can teach students how to behave appropriately while online.<sup>217</sup>More broadly, schools should ensure they are fostering an inclusive and tolerant environment so students will be encouraged to treat one another with respect while on social media.<sup>218</sup> These proactive measures will not erase all incidents of cyberbully
