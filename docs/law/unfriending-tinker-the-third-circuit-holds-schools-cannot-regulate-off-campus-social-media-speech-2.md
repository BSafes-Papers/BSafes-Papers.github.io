## II. A SCREENSHOT OF STUDENTS’ FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS
Between 1969 and 2007, the Supreme Court decided four student speech cases.<sup>27</sup> Many circuit courts have relied on these cases for guidance when addressing off-campus student speech.<sup>28</sup> However, their inconsistent approaches have confused school officials and demonstrated a need for further Supreme Court intervention.<sup>29</sup>

### A. *Before Social Media Went Viral: Supreme Court Decisions on Student Speech*

Over fifty years ago in *Tinker,* the Supreme Court stated that public school students do not lose their First Amendment rights while on school

Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 403 (2007) (finding “special characteristic of the school environment” enables schools to regulate student speech promoting illegal drug use (quoting *Tinker*, 393 U.S. at 506)); Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 271 (1988) (noting school officials may regulate expression associated with academic curriculum “to assure that participants learn whatever lessons the activity is designed to teach, that readers or listeners are not exposed to material that may be inappropriate for their level of maturity, and that the views of the individual speaker are not erroneously attributed to the school”); Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 683 (1986) (determining appropriate for school district to regulate vulgar student expression).

property.<sup>30</sup> The Court found the school’s punishment of three students for wearing headbands to be an unconstitutional restriction on speech.<sup>31</sup> The Court emphasized that “students . . . [do not] shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”<sup>32</sup>

Although *Tinker* clarified that students retain significant First Amendment rights while in school, these rights are not as extensive as those of a regular citizen.<sup>33</sup> The Court inserted a narrow exception that allowed school officials to regulate student speech that would “materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.”<sup>34</sup> Speech that is merely controversial or unpopular does not meet this standard.<sup>35</sup> Rather, the speech must threaten to disrupt the operation of the school or violate the rights of other students.<sup>36</sup>

A material and substantial disruption is not the only limit on students’ First Amendment rights while in school. In three cases following *Tinker*, the Supreme Court carved out additional exceptions.<sup>37</sup>These cases reaffirm that there are boundaries to students’ First Amendment rights in school.<sup>38</sup>

The first exception emerged in *Bethel School District* No. 403 v. Fraser. <sup>39</sup> In that case, Matthew Fraser used a sexual metaphor in a speech at a school assembly.<sup>40</sup> In response, the school suspended Fraser for two days.<sup>41</sup> The Court found the suspension did not violate the First Amendment because Fraser’s speech contained vulgar and offensive language.<sup>42</sup> The Court noted part of a school’s role is to exemplify and enforce appropriate forms of expression.<sup>43</sup> Unlike the political speech in *Tinker*, the sexual metaphor in Bethel affronted “the ‘fundamental values’ of public school education.”<sup>44</sup> 

The following year, the Court added another caveat to the *Tinker* exception in *Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier.* <sup>45</sup> In that case, the Court found a principal did not violate students’ First Amendment rights by removing student articles discussing divorce and abortion from a schoolsponsored newspaper.<sup>46</sup> The Court reasoned that the school, as the publisher of the paper, may set high standards for student speech and refuse publication if those standards are not met.<sup>47</sup> The Court stated schools must consider the maturity of the speech’s audience when trying to protect its students from inappropriate speech.<sup>48</sup> Thus, the Court held that it

is constitutionally permissible for schools to exercise this sort of control so long as it is “reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.”<sup>49</sup> In other words, censorship of a school-sponsored form of expression is acceptable if justified by a legitimate educational purpose.<sup>50</sup>

In 2007, *Morse v. Frederick*<sup>51</sup> added the final exception to Tinker. <sup>52</sup> While at an off-campus, school-supervised event, Joseph Frederick waved a banner that read “BONG HiTS 4 JESUS.”<sup>53</sup> When Frederick refused to take the banner down, the school principal issued him a ten-day suspension.<sup>54</sup> Ultimately, the Court upheld the suspension because the banner could reasonably be interpreted as promoting illegal drug use rather than articulating a political message.<sup>55</sup> The Court considered the speech “in light of the special characteristics of the school environment” and reasoned that the banner’s message contradicts the school’s interest in deterring drug use.<sup>56</sup> Moreover, the Court considered this a school speech case because Frederick was at a school-sponsored event and directed the banner at students.<sup>57</sup>

### B. *A Blurry Picture: The Differing Circuit Court Approaches to Off-Campus Social Media Speech*

Circuits have addressed the issue of off-campus student cyberspeech to varying outcomes.<sup>59</sup> Of these approaches, the Fourth Circuit’s sufficient nexus test most effectively balances First Amendment rights and the school’s need to maintain a safe environment.<sup>60</sup>

The Second Circuit typically has followed the reasonable foreseeability test, which examines whether it is reasonably foreseeable to school officials that the off-campus speech will reach school grounds.<sup>62</sup> If the answer is yes, the court applies the *Tinker* exception and asks whether the speech is likely to cause a substantial disruption.<sup>62</sup> If it is, school officials may discipline the student without running afoul of the First Amendment.<sup>63</sup>

Alternatively, before *B.L.*, rather than assessing whether the *Tinker* exception extends to instances of off-campus student speech, the Third Cir-

See id. at 730 (explaining that although most circuits have applied a form of the Tinker exception, they interpret and apply Tinker and its progeny in different ways); see also Daniel Marcus-Toll, Note, Tinker Gone Viral: Diverging Threshold Tests for Student Regulation of Off Campus Digital Student Speech, 82 FORDHAM L. REV. 3395, 3420 (2014) (“There is a split among the federal courts of appeals with respect to whether, and under what circumstances, [the Tinker exception] extends to offcampus student speech.”). In B.L. ex rel. Levy, the Third Circuit discussed the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Circuit approaches. See B.L. ex rel. Levy v. Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist., 964 F.3d 170, 180, 186–87 (3d Cir. 2020). For additional context, the Ninth Circuit applies the Tinker exception to cases of off-campus cyberspeech where there is “an identifiable threat of school violence.” Ferry, supra note 58, at 731 (outlining the circumstances which warrant invoking the exception). Furthermore, when faced with an instance of off-campus student cyberspeech, the Eleventh Circuit asks whether school officials were justified in expelling a student based on a combination of the Tinker exception and the true threat approach. See Boim v. Fulton Cty. Sch. Dist., 494 F.3d 978, 982 (11th Cir. 2007).

While at home, a student sent out a drawing of their English teacher being shot via instant message. Wisniewski, 494 F.3d at 35–36. As a punishment, the school suspended the student. *Id.* at 34–35. When addressing whether the suspension was constitutional, the court applied a combination of the reasonable foreseeability test and the *Tinker* exception. *See id. *at 40. It ultimately found that because the speech could reach school grounds and cause a substantial disruption. *Id.* Thus, the suspension was constitutional. *Id.*

cuit assumed that it applied.<sup>64</sup> In *J.S. ex rel. Snyder v. Blue Mountain School District,*<sup>65</sup> an eighth grade student created a MySpace profile to poke fun at their school principal.<sup>66</sup> Consequently, the school suspended J.S.<sup>67</sup> To assess the constitutionality of this suspension, the Third Circuit focused on the student’s intent.<sup>68</sup> To uphold the suspension, the school had to provide express evidence that the student intended for the speech to make its way onto school grounds and that readers would take its content seriously.<sup>69</sup> Because the student made the page private, the Third Circuit found it unlikely that the speech would cause a substantial disruption.<sup>70</sup> Thus, the student’s suspension was unconstitutional.<sup>71</sup>

The Fourth Circuit has followed the sufficient nexus test.<sup>72</sup> This test asks whether the off-campus conduct is sufficiently connected to the school’s pedagogical interests to warrant punishment.<sup>73</sup> A school can regulate off-campus student speech if doing so protects the well-being of students and promotes education.<sup>74</sup> Applying the sufficient nexus test in

***

*Kowalski v. Berkeley County Schools*, <sup>75</sup> the Fourth Circuit held that a school could punish a student who created a MySpace page to post hateful comments about a peer.<sup>76</sup> Although the incident occurred off campus, the Fourth Circuit said it was reasonably foreseeable to the student that their speech could create a substantial disruption in school because most of the people who interacted with the page were students.<sup>77</sup> Furthermore, the Fourth Circuit recognized that bullying and harassment are serious issues, and schools must be able to take action to maintain a safe environment.<sup>78</sup> The court noted that “the Constitution is not written to hinder school administrators’ good faith efforts to address [bullying and harassment].<sup>79</sup>

Unlike other circuits, the Fifth Circuit has declined to articulate a specific test for off-campus cyberspeech.<sup>80</sup> Rather, the Fifth Circuit has applied the Tinker exception on a case-by-case basis.<sup>81</sup> In *Bell v. Itawamba County School Board,* <sup>82</sup> a student created a rap video that accused two sports team coaches of sexual misconduct.<sup>83</sup> The Fifth Circuit applied the Tinker exception and held that the school may punish the student because the student intentionally directed the speech at the school.<sup>84</sup>
