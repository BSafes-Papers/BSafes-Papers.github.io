## CHAPTER 2 METHODOLOGY
Using a quantitative method approach for this study seemed more adept due to the fact that past researchers used the same method of using a survey to discover their findings. It made more sense going into the research to rely on this repetitive approach of conducting an online questionnaire as opposed to other methodologies. Having an online questionnaire was the most cost effective and accessible for participants to respond. The 19-question questionnaire was conducted through *Google Forms* with 60 college-aged respondents between October 18th, 2020 to November 2nd, 2020. The sample was taken students among working in the Undergraduate Admissions office, Saluki Ambassador Program, and distributed among students with access to Desire to Learn database. The limitations of the method were taken into account.

This is a convenience sample of college students at Southern Illinois university Carbondale. It is to be considered at this is a pilot study for academic research. Part of the questionnaire included open ended questions about knowing their habits of social media and explain their interactions and experiences. Other questions included closed questions on the various topics about what popular social media platforms are used. The data was generated from the Google Forms automatically and calculated the responses. Major finding and majority of the responses were sifted out of the data.
