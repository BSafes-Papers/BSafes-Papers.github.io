## Abstract
Communication technology, especially smartphones and the social media apps on them, has become a very large part of the modern world. People of all ages spend hours every day on social media either posting about their experiences or viewing other posts. Though social media can be fun and sometimes useful, it can also have negative effects on mental health, especially in adolescence. Researchers have done studies on these effects and developed scales to measure impacts like social media addiction. These studies show correlation between social media addiction and conduct disorders, depression, and deteriorating social skills. There are resources available to help people become aware of their social media habits and improve them. This program is going to give students the information about social media addiction, emotional regulation, and skills to help them become more mindful of social media use.
