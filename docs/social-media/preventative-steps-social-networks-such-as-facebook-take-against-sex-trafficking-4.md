## CHAPTER 4 DISCUSSION
What can the social media platform, Facebook, do in combatting and preventing these illicit activities from happening? Getting ahead in confronting sex trafficking may restore the faith which was lost in Facebook. Outlining suggestive steps and preventive measures may assure that users, particularly minors, can use Facebook without worries of sexual traffickers attacking them. Perhaps developing a media strategy campaign on the recognizing the signs of sex trafficking will restore faith and integrity into the social network. Other measures would ensure Facebook takes a strong stance against sexual trafficking and protecting its younger audience.

On the social media platform’s website, Facebook has a helpful guide for its users should they encounter questionable behavior. 

From their help center Abuse Resource sub-section, Facebook explained if users become in contact with someone that may be participating in human/sex trafficking. According to the page, users are to contact 911 or local law enforcement and report the content to the website (Facebook.com). The page also mentions the partnership with Polaris and the National Human Trafficking Hotline in providing resources for victims and survivors of human trafficking.

They continue to list resource website links from different countries with their contact information. While this resource is great and necessary, the website lacks a preventive approach. On the surface level, most of the information provided is available elsewhere on search engines. Facebook would need a catered design that prevents sex traffickers from abusing the website and recruiting members.

According to Bouché, “there is a significant amount of room for the technology industry to develop advanced and sophisticated tools to combat [domestic minor sex trafficking]”. For instance, developing advertisements for victims will help them be aware that help exists. This may increase the credibility of Facebook in recognizing the need of social awareness for sex trafficked victims.

By doing so, Facebook can be a leader on “improving visibility of help resources such as helplines on platforms known to be frequented by DMST victims could increase opportunities for exiting the life” (Survivor Insights: The Role of Technology in Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking, Bouché, 2018). With many technological resources, "Facebook has the technology to be able to potentially develop algorithms to look for the indicators and the red flags of potential [trafficking] exploitation and abuse” (Lawsuit Accuses Facebook Of Enabling Human Traffickers, Lozano, 2018). For example, Latonero reported on how Facebook has applied Microsoft’s PhotoDNA on its social networking site. The technology has the ability of locating and removing images of child pornography.

Another way Facebook can further its efforts is offering features and tools for accessing ongoing safety needs. Developing monitoring software catching common words, phrases, or patterns could help at-risk users. Similar to a language used for individuals considering and/or attempting suicide can be made for at-risk individuals for human trafficking and have messaging of the Human Trafficking National Hotline (A Roadmap For Systems and Industries to Prevent and Disrupt Human Trafficking, Anthony, 2018). Potentially, these measures, if in place, can ensure the social media platform is doing everything in their power in to protect its users and provide a safer and healthier environment for people to connect.

Using these examples will put forth a positive direction Facebook needs in diminishing sex traffickers recruiting victims. Identifying a few grooming techniques will be a necessary tool in combating against sex trafficking and protecting minors from this danger. Facebook’s image and brand have been shaken and questioned over the last few years because of the alleged misuse of data, privacy, and protection.

Defining a clear stance on issues such as combatting against sex trafficking could brand social media gives the platform, Facebook, the ability to develop credibility amongst its users. After having a lawsuit filed against them and questionable actions of misuse of users’ data, Facebook requires proactive approach in diminishing sexual trafficking activity on its platform. In order to protect future and current users, it is imperative for the social media platform set up protective blocks in order to stop sex trafficking.
