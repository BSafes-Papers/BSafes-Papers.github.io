## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I’d like to thank to my Professor, Bridget Lescelius, on her dedication in helping me with this research. Thank you to my family for supporting me on this journey, and my husband for being their when I needed him most tackling sensitive subjects.

## DEDICATION
This research is dedicated to the strong voices that fought for their voice to be heard. May they continue to strive to seeking freedom. 

## PREFACE
The increasing use of social media enables predators to seek out and recruit victims through social networking sites. The overall goal is outsmarting their manipulation on users by understanding and exposing their techniques to families and communities.

Social media network, in particular Facebook, are a feeding ground for sexual predators with the use of media as a tool to lure, recruit, and control victims. Knowing the process of recruiting for online sex trafficking will protect users and be more aware of the dangers on social media. With a sex trafficking lawsuit pending against Facebook, the social media network needs to be more proactive in providing better security for its users or risk legal ramifications.
