## CHAPTER 3 RESULTS
From the respondents from the questionnaire, the results were alarming when it came to question on how to report sexual predators on social media apps. From the Figure 1 below, out of the 60 respondents, 50% have answered that they did not know the steps needed to take. This can be inferred to why there is great lack of report of sexual misconduct on Facebook. If users are not knowledgeable about how to report misconduct, it needs to be addressed by the social network in making the information easier for users to obtain.

**Figure 1, Reporting Sexual Predators**

Another result from the questionnaire was to give their opinion on the knowing how to use Internet safety guidelines. 41% of respondents claimed that they were either unaware of the safety measures needed on the Internet or wasn’t sure how effective they were. The lack of trust and knowledge on Internet safety and were not reporting on social media apps should be a concern for Facebook. These are their users, and it matters that they are all clear on what to do if they encounter sexual predators on their website.

In order for users on Facebook to feel safe on its network, it’s important for users’ safety to be protected which also included their privacy. The survey resulted with 55% of respondents claiming that they do not feel that their privacy is protected within social media apps. Five respondents gave their opinion by stating they are afraid of their accounts being hacked and watched over by people who would take advantage of them. It should be of the importance of any social media network, including Facebook, in ensuring that their user's privacy is not at risk.

When asked if the respondents have ever interacted with strangers on social media apps, 40% of the results with having communication. They were then prompted to continuing giving clarity to which social media apps the interaction taken place.

**Figure 2, Strangers on Social Media**

As seen down above on Figure 2, Facebook is the highest result of the interactions people use when it comes to strangers. This becomes a great risk factor because of the potential opportunity to be in contact with sex traffickers. They can be very charismatic and disguise themselves into something that they are not. If strangers befriend people on social media networks, the importance and responsibility fall on both the user and the social network in making sure that they verify strangers and protect themselves from harm. With the added nature of sexual predators lurking on social networks, privacy and safety has to be better communicated from Facebook to users.
