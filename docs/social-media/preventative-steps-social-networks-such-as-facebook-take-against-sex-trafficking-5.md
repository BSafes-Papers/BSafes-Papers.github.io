## CHAPTER 5 SUMMARY
Sex traffickers are using social media to lure potential victims, and Facebook remains the largest social network that has most users. This became a breeding ground for sexual predators to disguise themselves and lie about their identity to recruit potential victims. They come in the form of being friendly online and building a relationship in order to gain their trust.

It is dangerous for uses to be unaware of the potential threat of sexual trafficking on Facebook. The social network has tried to overcome this by setting features in place to deter the crime. However, there is still more to work to do. Facebook can be the leader on protecting its users by identifying key verbiage and prohibiting compromised photos online that indict trafficking. They have the technology to implement ideas that will make it harder for sex traffickers to be on their website.

The pending lawsuit against Facebook will test the social networks capability and responsibility of keeping its users safe from harm. However, if Facebook leads themselves as a proactive social network against sex trafficking, they may have hopes of gaining the trust back from its users.
