### Questionnaire

Hi, my name is Alliyah Bridges and I am M.S. Professional Media & Media Management graduate student with Southern Illinois University Carbondale. 

The survey will be completed online. You must be 18 years old to do this survey. We encourage you to complete the survey in one sitting, which typically takes about 10 to 12 minutes. There are questions that may choose to not participate. You may skip any questions you are not comfortable answering.

The topic is providing feedback on the links between social media apps, privacy, and human trafficking within the United States. We will take all reasonable steps to protect your identity. Your identity and answers will be kept private from other third parties. After the end of this research, the record answers will be destroyed. The completion and return of this survey indicate voluntary consent to participate in this study.
