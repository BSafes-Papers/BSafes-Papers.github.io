<sup>74</sup> Interestingly, a comparison of the video recording session with the actress reading the scripts for the Latina TSA AVA, and footage of the final holograms, reveals that the AVA hologram is shown with lighter skin than the actress in the original footage. Though it is hard to tell in the video screenings if this disjuncture is a result of lighting or poor recording quality, it seems plausible that the hologram’s skin was lightened purposely for the display. This design choice is consistent with ideologies of whiteness that shape notions of national inclusion through proximity to whiteness.
