## VI. Unilateral Economic Sanctions and the Fight Against Terrorism
Despite the increase use of economic sanctions efforts, terrorist organizations continue to use illicit and undercover means to gain access to funds in the global financial system.<sup>187</sup> As a result, the U.S., as the lone financial superpower in the world, has used multiple financial measures against its adversaries in an innovative and effective manner.<sup>188</sup> In recent years, the internationalization of terrorism has become an undeniable characteristic of the modern world.<sup>189</sup> It can be said that non-state actors, including terrorist organizations, will continue to play a more prominent role in global affairs.<sup>190</sup> In this regard, the conventional method of viewing terrorism in terms of nation-states is obsolete, and even dangerous.

Traditional norms of war and armed conflict are comprehensive and rich in addressing the actions of state adversaries but are not as well suited to address the actions of non-state adversaries.<sup>191</sup> While non-state adversaries, such as terrorist organizations, have existed for decades, most of the legal infrastructure remains best adapted to confronting state rather than nonstate adversaries. Traditional doctrines of war do not meet the new realities

of non-state adversaries who play a more significant role in contemporary warfare.<sup>192</sup> For this reason, the lack of “comity, reciprocity, and accountability” amongst non-state adversaries raises new legal challenges.<sup>193</sup> Nevertheless, many non-state adversaries reside in places governed by state adversaries or neutral states making it far more difficult to identify who the nonstate actor is.<sup>194</sup> Certain actions by non-state adversaries, such as those using cyber financial weapons, recognition is challenging or almost impossible, often making enforcement action unachievable at a reasonable and satisfactory level.<sup>195</sup> 

There are a variety of debates about terrorism and its origins. In one sense, terrorism is an act of political expression that generates public attention to a specific group or cause.<sup>196</sup> In another sense, it is a manifestation of desperation and hopelessness for a better way of life.<sup>197</sup> Many, however, address the origins of modern terrorism in poverty, religion, and envy.<sup>198</sup> If a society is isolated and unable to modernize, expand, and enter the world economy, people will have little opportunity to earn a living, and this in turn will produce waves of resentment against those who profit from the otherwise growing global market.<sup>199</sup> 

Terrorist groups have a common tradition of recruiting members from the poor who have few opportunities to support themselves.<sup>200</sup> Terrorist groups recognize that a lack of economic opportunities combined with a lack peaceful alternatives to alleviating hardship allows terrorist ideologies to take root.<sup>201</sup> “To pretend that the issue of terrorism is simply a choice

between good and evil is to know nothing of human psychology.”<sup>202</sup> Public despair and political and social humiliation provide fertile ground for terrorist to exploit and more easily manipulate the minds of desperate individuals, not always in the name of religion but sometimes in the name of revenge or as an act of political empowerment. <sup>203</sup> One of the mentioned objectives of Al Qaeda is revenge for the alleged historical mistreatment of Muslims around the world.<sup>204</sup>For some of these individuals, terrorist actions are empowering because the act does not rely on their government taking action against perceived wrongs and the act gives voice to their frustration against an enemy state with superior strength. <sup>205</sup>

In his final speech in the U.K., President Bill Clinton acknowledged “how abject poverty accelerates conflict, how it creates recruits for terrorists and those who incite ethnic and religious hatred, [and] how it fuels a violent rejection of the economic and social order on which our future depends.”<sup>206</sup> The Bush Administration expressed a similar sentiment when it indicated that it “is aware of the link between desperate economic circumstances and terrorism.”<sup>207</sup> The Middle East is the main target for terrorist recruiters due to its exceptionally high unemployment rate, the absence of GDP growth, and lack of free markets and stable financial institutions.<sup>208</sup> However, international and state counter-terrorism initiatives have generally ignored the root causes of terrorism. Although the 1999 U.S. government profile on terrorism acknowledged this point, its post September 11 agendas have largely overlooked it.<sup>209</sup> As such, most terrorism prevention effort focused on stopping terrorism via nation-wide economic sanctions is not effective.

Economic sanctions do have a significant impact on the economy of a developing nation.<sup>210</sup> But the negative effects of an increased unemployment rate, reduced opportunities to export goods, and the inability to receive substantial international aid are felt more severely by the population than by the intended governmental targets.<sup>211</sup> Even when the population is struggling to establish an adequate living environment under a powerless government, these governments find ways to finance or support extremist groups.<sup>212</sup> Moreover, when people encounter poverty and lack of resources due to economic sanctions, this further encourages western hostility.<sup>213</sup> The sanctions may establish a setting for dissatisfaction and hostility which foster ideological extremism and terrorism.<sup>214</sup> 

Effective antiterrorism policies need to address the central issues that promote terrorism. As Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma explained: “[O]ur national security improves when global stability prevails.”<sup>215</sup> As such, global stability may require sanction imposing countries to consider alternatives to nation-wide sanctions. A nation without diplomatic relations is almost isolated, which precludes the improvement of social changes and results in defensive governmental actions. <sup>216</sup> Therefore diplomatic relations and negations between sanction imposing governments and sanctioned countries prevents isolation and enhances social development, thus facilitating human rights and economic integration.<sup>217</sup> 

As terrorism becomes more internationalized, non-state terrorism has adapted to exists on the fringe of economic activity or completely outside the ordinary economy.<sup>218</sup> Consequently, the economy of non-state terrorist organization is less impacted by nation-wide sanctions, in contrast to statesponsored terrorism.<sup>219</sup> Increasing evidence shows the degree to which

terrorist organizations, especially non-state organizations, receive funds through the illegal trade on drugs.<sup>220</sup> The U.S. government has evidence that Hezbollah and terrorist groups in Yemen and Lebanon have earned direct profits from the selling of methamphetamine in Chicago, Detroit, and other U.S. cities.<sup>221</sup> Among Islamic terrorist organizations, no organization has been more involved in illegal drug trade than the Taliban in Afghanistan.<sup>222</sup> The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has proposed that Osama binLaden may have directly supported the trade of heroin from Afghanistan to fund terrorist activities.<sup>223</sup> 

The modern financial infrastructure is the new sphere of war.<sup>224</sup> This new sphere provides a special fighting space for adversaries since they may be able to steal large amounts of money through cyberterrorist activities to fund other terrorist activities while also causing widespread financial crisis and damage.<sup>225</sup> “Unlike previous wartime theaters, the financial theater of war is less defined by geography and more by its critical functions, assets, and liabilities” which “presents new risks, threats and vulnerabilities for modern warfare posed by a cast of familiar and unfamiliar antagonists.” 

<sup>226</sup> The new mechanisms of terrorist financing freezing and confiscations of assets, has led to systematic cooperation between governments and international organizations to fight against terrorist financing.<sup>227</sup> Although, the FATF has established sanctions as a critical step to prevent terrorist funding, it may not be enough to just freeze suspected assets, the FATF must rely on foreign governments to police bank records to prevent the financing of terrorism.<sup>228</sup> Furthermore, as a result of terrorists’ access to technology, the current terrorist threat is worrying because of the significant impact it could have on financial markets and a country’s development.<sup>229</sup> Terrorist organizations have also founded non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to recruit members and spread information of terrorist targets; to receive official recognition from governments and international organizations, such as the U.N.; for their humanitarian activities; and to collect donations.<sup>230</sup> One of the

nine modern terrorism-related dangers identified by the FATF is the creation of terrorist front organizations as legitimate NGOs.<sup>231</sup> 

Despite the apparent weakness and ineffectiveness of economic sanctions, they remain an excellent alternative to military force. When properly collaborated, nation-wide sanctions can be an effective deterrent policy, as seen when sanction dissuaded both South Korea and Taiwan from their pursuit of nuclear weaponry in the 1970s and reversed a coup in Paraguay in 1996. <sup>232</sup> 

Although sanctions may be an effective policy choice, sometimes they are not given enough time to be successful. <sup>233</sup> Moreover, as shown by sanctions against Russia and Cuba, even when sanctions are given time, they are not always effective in achieving the desired policy goals. Despite the poor track record of sanctions, they remain popular because they are a “powerful expression of disagreement” with the target country’s policies and allow government leaders to show the electorate that they are taking action rather than doing nothing.<sup>234</sup> 

There is an ideological rift between those who see unilateral economic sanctions as efficient and helpful in achieving foreign policy goals and those who find sanctions to be ineffective or counterproductive. <sup>235</sup> According to an analysis of the 54 U.S. unilateral economic sanction cases between 1970 and 2014, success was only achieved in eleven cases.<sup>236</sup>

Overall, only a third of economic sanctions are estimated to be successful, with success defined as making a significant contribution to substantial achievement of foreign policy outcomes sought by the sanction imposing country. <sup>237</sup>
