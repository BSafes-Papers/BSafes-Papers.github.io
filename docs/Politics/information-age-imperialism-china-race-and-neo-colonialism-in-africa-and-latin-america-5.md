## V. COLONIALISM

### A. *The Colonial Encounter*

More than two hundred years ago, colonialism was packaged and sold to the world as a benign, civilizing mission for the benefit of peoples of color in Africa, Latin America, North America, India, Australia, and Asia.<sup>116</sup> Trade was a primary driving force of colonial expansion.<sup>117</sup> Doctrines were written to provide trading companies like the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company quasi-sovereign rights over indigenous peoples.

charters provided the right to trade in specific areas and the ability to take certain political action, like coining money or starting a martial campaign against indigenous peoples.<sup>118</sup> By the nineteenth century, European states assumed direct responsibility for colonial lands.<sup>119</sup> For instance, in 1858, the British East India Company was dissolved to make way for British colonial rule. This change entailed a critical shift in the ideology justifying Empire in terms of commodities to a new, sterner language of order, hierarchy and governance. The new approach was articulated at the Berlin Conference,<sup>120</sup> during 1884-85, when European colonial powers divided indigenous lands in Africa.<sup>121</sup> Critically, too, the Berlin Conference acted as a pressure valve for inter-European rivalries; for example, African lands were exchanged and bartered to ease Continental politics.<sup>122</sup>

<sup>120</sup> The Berlin Conference (1884-85) regulated colonial spheres of interest in parts of Africa. Representatives of Europe’s leading powers, as well as Turkey and the United States, convened the Berlin Conference to decide to whom Congo belonged and to formalize rules for future acquisition of African lands. The final act of the conference (Berlin Act) in 1885 excluded African input and became a foundation for European colonial expansion in Africa. In certain respects, the Berlin Act was limited: it did not apply to past occupations or to the interior of Africa and only in the reciprocal relations of the signatory states. In practice, however, the Berlin Act has much wider application as its terms represented an emerging consensus as to all territorial expansion regardless of location or parties involved. Ultimately, the Berlin Act led to a series of monopolistic possessions characterized by violence and coercion. For more indepth analysis, see Olufunmilayo B. Arewa, *Colonialism, Legal Borrowing, and Disruption in Africa, *113 AM. SOC’Y INT’L L. PROC. 66, 66 (2019); Matthew M.

### B. *The Creation of ‘Race’*

Race is a social construct. Indeed, race operates *solely* as a social construct and was a critical method of defining ‘the other’ in colonial contexts.<sup>123</sup> As notions of race are responsive to the needs of power elites, its social construction and concomitant expressions of racism alter from time and place. Writing in 1856, leading transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about the significance of race as caste, a type of social predestination segregating the elect and non-elect: “race … puts the hundred millions of India under the dominion of a remote island in the north of Europe.”<sup>124</sup> Over a century ago, American sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois studied the problem of the creation of ‘race.’ He was profoundly troubled race was getting substituted as a biological explanation for what he knew to be social and cultural differences amongst people.<sup>125</sup> Mainstream science today wholeheartedly embraces W.E.B. Du Bois’ views.<sup>126</sup> As one leading scientist of the human genome put it, “[t]he more we learn about humankind’s genetic differences … the more we see that they have almost nothing to do with what we call race.”<sup>127</sup> As ‘race’ is a social construct, racism is born from social legacies of oppression.<sup>128</sup> Further, ‘race’ was a useful concept to colonizers; it was a metric of differentiation.<sup>129</sup>Colonizers pointed to the differentiation to

### C. *Colonialism in Africa*

The colonial state in Africa was extant less than a century in most cases.<sup>131</sup>Yet the effects of colonialism are lasting and profound, not least because the practice created arbitrary territorial boundaries while reordering political spaces, modes of economic production, and exploiting societal cleavages.<sup>132</sup> According to historian Michael Crowder, the portrait of Africa painted by the colonial powers was one of a people who, on the eve of occupation, were politically decentralized, living in small enclaves, dominated by unscientific fears of the natural world, and living in perpetual fear of attack.<sup>133</sup> Thus was born the fantasy that Africa required Europe to save it.<sup>134</sup> The voracious rapidity of the so-called “Scramble for Africa” was astounding: in half a generation, Europe gained virtually an entire continent that included ten million square miles of new territory and 110 million subjects.<sup>135</sup>

Perhaps nowhere in Africa was the colonizer’s avarice on display more than the Congo. For most of the nineteenth century, Belgium’s Parliament remained indifferent to colonial enterprise.<sup>136</sup> The Belgian royal family, however, relished colonial ambitions. Leopold I, father of the infamous Leopold II of the Congo, knowing outright conquest of Africa was impossible, set about purchasing

large swaths of territory.<sup>137</sup> He had a good historical model in President Thomas Jefferson’s Louisiana Purchase, accomplished scant decades earlier. Leopold I failed numerous times. He could not buy Guatemala, Crete, Fiji, the New Hebrides and even a part of Texas which the United States acquired after the Mexican-American War.<sup>138</sup> When Leopold I died in 1865, Leopold II ascended the Belgian throne and continued his father’s work of empire.<sup>139</sup> He was determined, as he put it, to get “a slice of this magnificent African cake.”<sup>140</sup> Leopold II created ruses whole cloth to gin up support for his enterprise; for instance, he was the chief proprietor of an organization whose stated purpose was saving African souls from Islam.<sup>141</sup> Highly regarded throughout Europe as the “philanthropic” monarch, he welcomed Christian missionaries to the Congo.<sup>142</sup> His soldiers found acclaim in Continental newspapers; faded ink on brittle pages tell triumphal stories of troops battling local slavetraders bent on capturing fellow humans and reducing them to a price.<sup>143</sup> Not to be outdone, Leopold II’s main agent, Henry Stanley, a notorious self-promoter in his own right, already famous for his apocryphal greeting, “Dr. Livingston, I presume?”<sup>144</sup> depicted the Congo and its inhabitants as the backdrop for narratives of Whites bestowing ‘civilization’ and religion to the people of Africa.<sup>145</sup> Leopold II first met Stanley in 1878 and in December of that year Stanley signed a 5-year contract to establish the Congo enterprise.<sup>146</sup> Leopold II never visited the region that was his personal fief. The inaptly named Congo Free State was soon “awash in corpses.”<sup>147</sup> It is estimated Belgium’s exploitation of the Congo reduced the

region’s population by ten million people.<sup>148</sup> It is an understatement to say that during its relatively brief existence between 1885 and 1908, the Belgian Congo was the situs of unspeakable horrors.

The breakup of indigenous societies under colonial rule was the subject of Chinua Achebe’s 1958 anti-colonial masterpiece *Things Fall Apart.* Achebe was writing, as he often expressed, against the Africa of Joseph Conrad’s *Heart of Darkness,* that classic work of colonial apologia.<sup>149</sup> In a polemic against Conrad’s depiction of African peoples, Achebe commented on a few sentences from *Heart of Darkness:* “[t]his passage, which is Conrad at his best, or his worst, according to the reader’s predilection, goes on at some length … And then Conrad delivers the famous coup de grâce. Were these creatures really human?”<sup>150</sup> Achebe’s *Things Fall Apart *is a powerful counterpoint to *Heart of Darkness.* At the novel’s end, the reader is left only with the erroneous, bereft musings of a middling colonial bureaucrat.<sup>151</sup> The systemic iniquities described in Things

<sup>151</sup> In writing about his Igbo homeland, Achebes *Things Fall Apart* accomplished what Conrad never could in providing a counterpoint to European colonialism and tragic farce. *See generally,* CHINUA ACHEBE, THINGS FALL APART (Penguin Books 1958). Okonkwo’s suicide and erasure of his voice, and by extension, the complete society and culture of his people, is the more powerful for it: “In the many years in which [the Commissioner] had toiled to bring civilization to different parts of Africa he had learned a number of things . . . [to avoid giving] the natives a poor opinion of him. In the book he planned to write he would stress that point. As he walked back to the court he thought about that book . . . The story of this man who had killed a messenger and hanged himself would make interesting reading. One could almost write a whole chapter on him. Perhaps not a whole chapter but a reasonable paragraph, at any rate.

*Fall Apart* meant that the transition from colony to successful nation-state has not been easy for many African countries. After brutalizing Africans and siphoning the land’s natural resources for decades, the various colonial powers granted independence to the scattered nations of Africa without preparing the new rulers to handle their devastated economies and various ethnic groups.<sup>152</sup> In many instances, the departing colonial powers perpetuated their abuse of African resources through the imposition of constitutions which maintained the privileges of the immigrant European population at the expense of indigenous peoples.<sup>153</sup> Apartheid South Africa is but a single example. Not surprisingly, a fair percentage of the post-colonial African leaders emulated the savagery of the colonizers and heaped misery, warfare, poverty, and hunger upon their own.<sup>154</sup>

### D. *Colonialism in Latin America*

The nations comprising Latin America came into existence after the arrival of Europeans to the coastal region of eastern South America and the Caribbean Islands during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.<sup>155</sup> When considering the region’s history, it is important to “face east” and remember Latin America has a history that stretches back much further in time than the arrival of the Spanish and Portuguese.<sup>156</sup> These colonial societies quickly became rigidly hierarchical with severely constrained social mobility for indigenous peoples, peoples of mixed heritage, and persons of

African descent.<sup>157</sup> Hector Meléndez, a scholar of Latin American history, locates the region’s colonial domination as a collective wound binding the region together while moving forward through time.<sup>158</sup> Legal historian Francisco Valdés views the Spanish legacy in Latin America as causing the destruction of native civilizations and wholesale genocide.”<sup>159</sup> Broadly constructed, there were three overarching stages or epochs of colonial enterprise: (1) 1500 – 1800, characterized by the transfer of wealth from indigenous societies to Europe; (2) 1800 – 1950, the continued impoverishment of the region albeit sometimes directed from inter-Latin power sources; and (3) 1950 – 1970, dubbed the “neocolonial period” and characterized by wealth transfer through local development and export-led industrialization strategies.<sup>160</sup>

During the early modern period, Latin American colonialism was rooted in the exploitation of the bountiful natural resources held by indigenous peoples and the imposition of Spanish-Portuguese centric values, culture, and religion.<sup>161</sup> Violence was a constant feature of the experience.<sup>162</sup> Laying the foundation for the so-called “Black Legend,” in his *Brief Account of the Devastation of the West Indies*, published in 1542, the Dominican Friar Bartolomé de Las Casas said the following about atrocities the Spanish committed in Peru:

> “After having killed not only all people of rank but almost all males capable of bearing arms, the Spaniards subjected the rest … [of the indigenous peoples] to devilish serfdom and exacted slaves as a

>tribute . . . . Shiploads of which were sent to Peru to be sold. Beyond this [the Spaniards] committed so many murderous deeds and atrocities that an entire kingdom … which had been one of the most populous and fertile on earth was utterly destroyed.”<sup>163</sup>

The “Black Legend,” a tradition of anti-Spanish criticism, was popular among European powers from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries not least as an ideological weapon in the struggle amongst European powers for colonial possessions.<sup>164</sup> In response, Spanish colonial apologists fashioned a “White Legend,” whereby colonial violence was downplayed and a type of *pax hispanica* ended the supposed endemic warfare amongst indigenous groups.<sup>165</sup>

The U.S. issued the Monroe Doctrine in 1823. The doctrine held that the independent republics of the Americas would never be recolonized and remain free from European intervention.<sup>166</sup> The doctrine’s stated purpose of noninterventionism was not intended and in fact did not apply to the U.S.<sup>167</sup> The Monroe Doctrine was understood in Latin America as a type of “imperial edict” that had the twin effect of undermining the sovereignty and selfdetermination of Latin American nations.<sup>168</sup> Unlike the European colonial experience in Africa, U.S. colonialism in Latin America was not a form of territorial acquisition as much as a particular form of socio-political domination.<sup>169</sup> The arc of history shows the U.S. expanded its sphere of influence southwards and increasingly intervened in Latin America to advance, in part, its own commercial

interests.<sup>170</sup> These practices reached a crescendo during the Theodore Roosevelt Administration and his “big stick” approach to international politics, which granted the U.S. authority to exercise “international police power” in the Western Hemisphere. One unintended consequence of the “big stick” approach is that “many Latin American radicals and nationalists historically have looked upon the United States as their natural enemy.”<sup>171</sup> This perspective, especially applied to the post-war inter-American relationship, views U.S. colonialism in Latin America in terms of unequal treaties, interventionist trade regimes, and overbearing diplomatic directives.<sup>172</sup>
