## *V. Implications for Policymakers*
Cyberspace has long bedeviled policymakers, practitioners, and even novelists alike. As the science fiction author William Gibson admitted when he used the word ‘cyberspace’ in his book Neuromancer: “All I knew about the word ‘cyberspace’ when I coined it, was that it seemed like an effective buzzword. It seemed evocative and essentially meaningless. It was suggestive of something, but had no real semantic meaning, even for me, as I saw it emerge on the page.”<sup>277</sup> As with cyberspace generally, and has been shown through this Article the number of threats facing democratic institutions—including with regards to election security and digital repression—is long, and seemingly only growing longer.<sup>278</sup> Indeed, the likes of Henry Farrell and Bruce Schneier have argued that: “the open forms of input and exchange that it [democracy] relies on can be weaponized to inject falsehood and misinformation that erode democratic debate.”<sup>279</sup> Opinions vary as to whether to consider democracy itself as a cyber threat vector, and how to mitigate the risks, such as by doubling down on democratic institutions or relying on other actors—including the private sector—to better manage these issues such as the spread of disinformation through the EU-organized Code discussed in Part IV. This Part proceeds by summarizing the policy suggestions made throughout using an analytical framework pioneered by Peter Swire, among others.<sup>280</sup>

In 1948, George Kennan, an American diplomat and a historian, defined national security as “the continued ability of the country to pursue the development of its internal life without serious interference, or threat of interference, from foreign powers.”<sup>281</sup> Yet such a conception of national security is not so clear cut when the goal is protecting democracy itself, as seen in cases of Russian operatives organizing U.S. citizens to engage in activism during the 2016 election cycle.<sup>282</sup> Neither is an analytical framework to ascertain all the necessary steps that must be taken to harden democratic institutions against these attacks. What follows is a suggested path forward. Before turning to the work of Swire, though, it is first necessary to provide some context.

Numerous regulatory theorists and governance scholars have considered cyberspace, including the best ways to engender change in this dynamic, interconnected environment. Yochai Benkler, for example, has offered a three-layer structure to consider interventions, including: (1) the “physical infrastructure,” including the fiber-optic cables and routers making up the physical aspect of cyberspace; (2) the “logical infrastructure,” comprising necessary “software such as the TCP/IP protocol;” and (3) the “content layer,” which includes data and, indirectly, users.<sup>283</sup> This conceptualization, while helpful, only takes us so far in better understanding the various cyber threats facing democratic institutions and what to do about them. It largely ignores, for example, the role played by state and non-state actors in shaping the content layer.<sup>284</sup> Lawrence Lessig built from this model,<sup>285</sup> advocating for“decentralized innovation” making use of various modalities including interventions supporting layers.<sup>286</sup> However, Andrew Murray has concluded that this is “idealistic” and that, “the harnessing of one regulatory modality through the application of another is more likely to lead to further regulatory competition, due to the complexity of the network environment.”<sup>287</sup> Instead of solely relying on code, then, laws, norms, and markets also have important roles to play in shaping a polycentric response to addressing vulnerabilities in democratic election systems.<sup>288</sup>

One way to think through such a polycentric approach is to make use of Swire’s stack analogy,<sup>289</sup> offered in adapted form as Table 3. Under this formulation, the foregoing analysis was concerned with levels seven through ten, but the chart highlights the extent to which it is vital to secure the underlying system architecture including voting machines.

As Table 3 shows, there is a great deal that both the public and private sectors can do, locally and globally, to make democracy harder to hack. Particularly on levels eight through ten of Swire’s Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) stack analogy, which is popular among programmers in illustrating the various levels of systems, there is a great deal more that the U.S. and other democracies can and should be doing to secure vulnerable election infrastructure and combat digital repression.

In the United States, despite post-2016 funding, still more than two-thirds of U.S. counties report insufficient funding to replace outdated, vulnerable paperless voting machines, further help is needed.<sup>291</sup> Aside from appropriating sufficient funds to replace outdated voting machines and tabulation systems, Congress also should encourage states to follow Colorado’s example<sup>292</sup> (and the best practices listed in the EU Compendium) <sup>293</sup> by refusing to fund voting machines that use paperless ballots, and requiring risk-limiting audits, which use statistical samples of paper ballots to check if official election results are correct, to increase confidence in election outcomes. Congress should also require NIST to update their voting machine standards, which state and county election officials rely on in deciding which machines to purchase as in the case of Australia.<sup>294</sup> Further, a National Cybersecurity Safety Board could also be created to investigate cyber-attacks on U.S. election infrastructure and issue reports after elections to help ensure that vulnerabilities do not go unaddressed.<sup>295</sup> A crash course is also needed for local and county election officials across the nation.<sup>296</sup> There is an opportunity for both civil society and higher education to aid in this effort, as Indiana University is doing to help the Secretary of State’s Office prepare for a wide array of scenarios, conduct tabletop exercises, and create a cybersecurity guidebook for use by newly elected and appointed election officials.<sup>297</sup> Other states could engage in similar partnerships, along with pooling resources to create repositories of best practices.

Learning lessons from the case studies in Part IV, the U.S. government could build out the capability of DHS to ward off disinformation campaigns similar to Indonesia’s approach, as California is doing through its Secretary of State’s Office.<sup>298</sup> Ahead of the 2020 election cycle, the United States could also work with allies around the world to build from the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace and the Christchurch Call with these specific actions, perhaps encapsulated in a Call to Safeguard Democracy.<sup>299</sup> The UN Group of Government Experts and standing working group should be leveraged in this effort, and new regional cybersecurity hubs created to speed the transfer of information between jurisdictions as has already been accomplished through the EU’s Cooperation Groups.<sup>300</sup> One possibility is a regional approach, such as a “South Pacific Elections—Information and Analysis Center (SPE-ISAC),” a potential solution to the lack of a cohesive Pacific regional cybersecurity group.<sup>301</sup>

Finally, with regards to disinformation in particular, the U.S. government could work with the EU to globalize the self-regulatory Code of Practice on Disinformation for social media firms (thus avoiding thorny First Amendment concerns).<sup>302</sup> It could also work to create new forums for international information sharing and more effective rapid alert and joint sanctions regimes.<sup>303</sup> The international community has the tools to act and hold accountable those actors that would threaten democratic institutions. Failing the political will to act, pressure from consumer groups and civil society will continue to mount on tech firms, in particular Facebook, which may be sufficient for them to voluntarily expand their efforts in the EU globally, the same way that more firms are beginning to comply with GDPR globally as opposed to designing new information systems for each jurisdiction.<sup>304</sup>
