## *IV. Lessons from Other Democracies*
Aside from the United States, other advanced and emerging democracies around the world are working to manage threats to their own election security, as well as creating strategies to manage digital repression and disinformation. These efforts form only one component of a larger debate happening around enhancing cybersecurity, which in turn suffers from a lack of clear definition. According to former General Michael Hayden, for example, “rarely has something been so important and so talked about with less clarity and less apparent understanding [than cybersecurity].”<sup>182</sup> This Part surveys some of these efforts to help provide a framework for discussion in Part V, which in turn considers a range of potential reforms to help make democracy harder to hack.

### *A. European Union*
This section begins by discussing EU protections for voting infrastructure. We next move on to analyze companion efforts from civil society, and the private sector.

#### *1. EU Efforts to Safeguard its Election Infrastructure*

Europeans went to the polls in 2019 for the first time in five years for widely anticipated elections.<sup>183</sup> Cybersecurity was a key concern going into the summer after a series of high-profile breaches and disinformation campaigns.<sup>184</sup> For example, electoral websites in the Netherlands were targeted by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in 2017,<sup>185</sup> as was the elections oversight body in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic.<sup>186</sup> Evidence is mounting as well of manipulation of the 2016 Brexit debate through the use of Facebook data.<sup>187</sup> As revealed by whistleblower Christopher Wylie at a hearing in the European Parliament, it is “almost certain that systematic fraud and voter deception took place . . . [and that] Facebook’s system allowed it to happen.”<sup>188</sup> Other recent examples include the release of thousands of internal documents of then French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron prior to his 2017 election victory.<sup>189</sup> However, unlike the DNC hack of 2016, this breach did not have a major impact on the French elections given that: (1) French media were prohibited from reporting on the breach within forty-four hours of the election; (2) the lack of a “thriving tabloid culture” in France as in the UK, or the equivalent of a Fox News Network; and (3) the actions of the Macron campaign 
in releasing faked documents to mislead the attackers.<sup>190</sup> There have also been spear phishing campaigns aimed at “German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union” party,<sup>191</sup> along with successful cyber-attacks on the German parliament (Bundestag),<sup>192</sup> and its federal data network.<sup>193</sup> In those attacks, the hackers had worked their way so deep into the system that the entire Bundestag IT architecture had to be rebuilt.<sup>194</sup> The breadth of these attacks remind us that a multifaceted approach is essential to the issues associated with influence, repression, and manipulation.

To its credit, the European Union has taken a more proactive approach to managing the full range of cyber-enabled threats facing the integrity of its democratic systems including both election security and disinformation than the United States has managed to date. First, most EU nations have minimized the use of technology in elections, with the Netherlands rejecting the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) entirely,<sup>195</sup> France backing away from the use of online voting after 2016,<sup>196</sup> and Germany stopping the use of EVMs due to a court order in 2005,<sup>197</sup> just to name a few national actions. Among the more important of these is the Network Information Security (NIS) Directive, which was adopted by the European Parliament in 2016 and was the first comprehensive piece of EU wide cybersecurity legislation.<sup>198</sup>

The NIS Directive requires that EU Member States work in cooperation<sup>199</sup> to improve cybersecurity risk management.<sup>200</sup> Unlike other attempts to combat cyber related issues, the NIS Directive expects nations to exchange information through Cooperation Groups, which may be considered a form of international ISAC.<sup>201</sup> Of particular note to the readers, the 2018 *Compendium on Cyber Security of Election Technology* summarized a wide array of election security best practices, including: “[A]nti-DoS protections, access control and authentication procedures for election IT systems, digital signatures and duplicate data-entry practices to ensure data integrity, network flow analysis and logging procedures, and network segmentation.”<sup>202</sup>

Despite the progress, it is important to note the *Compendium* takes a balanced, realistic approach to embracing cybersecurity. As pointed out by the report, despite the widespread use of analogue practices and paper ballots, cyber threats are not eliminated given that these same jurisdictions may still “rely on electronic solutions for voter and candidate registration, vote counting or the communication of the results” that could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, along with the myriad other risks shown in Table 1.<sup>203</sup> As such, the EU also embraces the use of risk-limiting audits that both monitor and ensure robust election security; however, these remain to be widely implemented across the EU.<sup>204</sup>

The EU’s groundbreaking General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is also a relevant and useful regime to better protect personal data, including with regards to political preferences. This is an expansive regulatory regime with a wide array of requirements on covered firms ranging from ensuring data portability and consent to mandating that firms disclose a data breach within seventy-two hours of becoming aware of the incident and then conducting a postmortem to ensure that a similar scenario will not recur. *See Top 10 Operational Responses to the GDPR,* INT’L ASS’N PRIV. PRO., https://perma.cc/Y3MM-LMH7 (providing access to different commentary related to the GDPR).

#### *2. EU Efforts to Combat Digital Repression*
As highlighted in Part II, faith in the democratic process also demands a firm commitment to combatting digital repression, including the need to manage disinformation. For example, in 2018, then President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said: “We must protect our free and fair elections.”<sup>205</sup> As such, the EU Commission proposed new rules building from the work of the Compendium to “better protect our democratic processes from manipulation by third countries or private interests.”<sup>206</sup> In particular, in 2018 the European Commission pushed Facebook, Google, and Twitter to sign the“Code of Practice on Disinformation,”<sup>207</sup> committing them to boost “transparency around political and issue-based advertising.”<sup>208</sup>

This initiative was groundbreaking since the technology industry agreed “to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation.”<sup>209</sup> Among other provisions, the Code requires signatories to cull fake accounts, create safeguards against misrepresentation, and the misuse of automated bots, along with empowering consumers and the broader research community.<sup>210</sup> In response, these firms have set up “searchable political-ad databases” and have begun to take down “disruptive, misleading or false” information from their platforms, and to reject ads that are inconsistent with election integrity policies.<sup>211</sup> In 2019, Twitter rolled out a reporting feature in which individuals can report a tweet with misleading information by clicking on a drop down menu, select “It’s misleading about voting,” choose an option that explains how the tweet is misleading, and submit the report to Twitter.<sup>212</sup> Unfortunately, this did not seem to have the impact desired, as several organizations reported EU election hashtags, such as EUElections2019, still “received a high level of suspiciously inorganic engagement.”<sup>213</sup> Similarly, an activist group called Avaaz found that, despite these efforts, that there were more than “500 far-right and anti-EU Facebook pages and groups” being followed by some thirty-two million people.<sup>214</sup>

In a similar regulatory vein, the Commission underscored the need for greater transparency in online political advertisements and targeting.<sup>215</sup> It also sought further regulation of online advertising campaigns such as by “disclosing which party or political support group is behind online political advertisements as well as by publishing information on targeting criteria used to disseminate information to citizens,”<sup>216</sup> and even called for national sanctions for the failure to comply with the new disclosure requirements.<sup>217</sup> And, to address potential difficulties arising from cyberinfrastructure issues in elections, the Commissions called for the creation of a Network of Cybersecurity Competence Centers, in cooperation amongst the EU Member States, to better target and coordinate available funding for cybersecurity cooperation, research and innovation.<sup>218</sup>

In a more widespread regulatory initiative, in June of 2019, the European Commission produced a report on the implementation of the Action Plan Against Disinformation (“Report”).<sup>219</sup> The Action Plan proposes a set of actions that should further enable a joint and coordinated EU approach to addressing disinformation. The Action Plan focuses on four pillars:

- (1) Improving the capabilities of the Union’s institutions to detect, analyze, and expose disinformation;
- (2) Strengthening coordinated and joint responses by EU institutions and Member States to disinformation;
- (3) Mobilizing the private sector to tackle disinformation; and
- (4) Raising awareness about disinformation and improving societal resilience.220

Within these pillars are previously unexplored areas of enhancements, which are not often considered within the context of cybersecurity. For example, in the area of communications, the European Commission declared the importance of supporting quality journalism as an essential element of a democratic society and “[c]ountering internal and external disinformation threats through strategic communication” while safeguarding the diversity and sustainability of the European news media ecosystem.<sup>221</sup>

***
<sup>219</sup>. *See generally Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions Concerning the Tackling of Online Disinformation*, COM (2018) 236 final (Apr. 26, 2018), https://perma.cc/C847- EPFX (PDF) [hereinafter Tackling Disinformation].

{: .fs-2}
<sup>221</sup>. *See Tackling Disinformation, supra* note 219, at 15. Building a more knowledgeable, media-savvy user, though, is no simple matter. Trust in media outlets takes time to build. We attach a given level of trust to an outlet based on our view of the institution, the organization, and our prior experience with the individual reporter. Yet, in the digital world, journalists proliferate, and no system of verifiable trustworthiness yet exists.
{: .fs-2}
***

The Action Plan encourages a “more transparent, trustworthy and accountable online ecosystem” while “fostering education and media literacy” to secure resilient election processes.<sup>222</sup> Key to this plan is the improvement of societal resilience in Europe and beyond to foster critical thinking and media-literate citizens.<sup>223</sup> This requires focus to be placed on improving the detection, analysis, and exposure of disinformation by investing in digital tools, data analysis skills, and specialized staff as well as strengthening efforts to assess the reach and impact of disinformation.<sup>224</sup> To accomplish such a lofty goal across the European Union, the Members will necessarily need to strengthen their cooperation and joint responses to disinformation as described above.<sup>225</sup>

One such attempt at coordination exists in the EU’s Rapid Alert System.<sup>226</sup> The system is designed to provide warnings on disinformation campaigns in real-time and national contact points for disinformation in the Member States.<sup>227</sup> It is designed to share real-time warnings, react and ensure coordination between EU capitals and Brussels, and has been active since March 2019.<sup>228</sup> A joint EU sanctions regime goes along with the early-warning system to better deter adversarial nations such as Russia from interfering with European Parliament elections,<sup>229</sup> though the effectiveness of this approach has been called into question.<sup>230</sup> In short, criticism has arisen that “[i]t’s not rapid. There are no alerts. And there’s no system.”<sup>231</sup> Core issues—such as the level at which an alarm should be sounded and how to incentivize robust, real-time information sharing—remain to be resolved.<sup>232</sup>

Further, and ahead of the European Parliament elections, in April 2019 ENISA hosted a “war game” that was focused on identifying governance gaps and deepening ties to aid in regional election security efforts. Such efforts can help train election officials across the EU, though much more remains to be done help get local staffers up to speed, which is a similar issue facing many campaigns and election boards in the United States. That is why the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center on Science and International Affairs, for example, has focused on training these officials on the basics of cyber hygiene and election security best practices.

At its most basic, the Report fails to “cover the issue of domestic or non-state actors in any substantive way or provide any real solutions.”<sup>233</sup> Yet it is overly simplistic to believe all misinformation is produced from foreign actors, as was discussed in Part II. The Report’s failure to appreciate the nature and varied sources of potential actors is a significant limitation.<sup>234</sup> Moreover, there has been little to suggest that the reporting to date has been as robust or useful as originally hoped.<sup>235</sup> Nonetheless, the report and various initiatives are noteworthy first steps to improve the EU’s election cybersecurity, steps that other nations are watching closely.

### *B. Illustrative Examples: Australia, Oceania, and Asia*

This section builds from the comparative transatlantic case study outlined above with illustrative examples from how other advanced and emerging democracies are both protecting their election infrastructure and working to fend off digital repression. We begin by examining Australia, before moving on to several examples from Oceania and Asia before summarizing our key findings and moving on to policy implications.

#### *1. Australia*
Australia, like EU Member States, the U.S., and other democracies throughout Oceania, is no stranger to disinformation campaigns and other attempts to subvert its democratic institutions.<sup>236</sup> The threats to Australian democracy do differ in several notable ways, though, from the nation’s other Western peers.<sup>237</sup> For example, voting is mandatory in Australia,<sup>238</sup> and the major parties in Australia must agree on boundary lines.<sup>239</sup> This thereby reduces some of the common issues that can arise in the context of broader U.S. democracy preservation conversations.<sup>240</sup> The process of voting is also distinct from its American and even some European counterparts.<sup>241</sup> For example, all Australians vote on paper, their votes are tallied by hand, and a robust Electoral Commission oversees the process to check for irregularities.<sup>242</sup> Australia has also taken the affirmative step of designating its political parties as critical infrastructure, similar to the U.K.’s approach,<sup>243</sup> along with investing in efforts to guard Australians against information warfare using micro-targeting.<sup>244</sup> The U.S., on the other hand, continues to rely on outdated technologies and systems despite years of warnings, as was discussed in Part III. Yet even these safeguards cannot inoculate Australia, the U.S., or any nation against the full range of attacks designed to influence public opinion, interfere with politicians, and the media.<sup>245</sup> For example, in February 2019, despite these efforts, the Australian Parliament was breached by a state-sponsored cyber-attack allegedly from China.<sup>246</sup>

Australia has no rapid-alert system or code of conduct of the kind being tried in the EU to better manage the spread of disinformation.<sup>247</sup> It did, however, sign both the Paris and Christchurch Calls, which are discussed further below, further isolating the United States as the only member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partners to stay out of these agreements.<sup>248</sup>

#### *2. Oceania*
Examining the regional context surrounding Australia is a useful exercise to better understand the unique approaches being taken by developing nations in response to the cyber threats they face.<sup>249</sup> Given the lack of attention in the area relative to other more often studied cyber powers, such a study is vital to help build resilience, and trust, in democratic systems of strategic significance in the South Pacific.<sup>250</sup>

As for election infrastructure, Pacific island nations’ election infrastructure and security efforts across Oceania range from quite sophisticated to relatively immature. New Zealand, for example, has a fairly robust, formal election infrastructure,<sup>251</sup> while in others—such as the Federated State of Micronesia, Kiribati, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu—there is little election infrastructure to monitor.<sup>252</sup> Yet many of the nations comprising Oceania do rely on paper ballot voting systems similar to the EU, are geographically isolated, and with the exception of New Zealand, have relatively small populations with historical connections to well-established democracies—namely the British Commonwealth, and the United States.<sup>253</sup>

The Russian hacking efforts during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign were direct and intensive.<sup>254</sup> In contrast, Chinese efforts in Australia and throughout Oceania have been more indirect. <sup>255</sup> Although China denies this, it is asserting itself militarily and economically throughout Oceania in an attempt to challenge the global reach and power of the United States, particularly in the Pacific.<sup>256</sup> In fact, there is little evidence of extensive hacking, instead China has sought to influence policy through economic assistance and political contributions to candidates and parties,<sup>257</sup> a strategy which these nations have yet to effectively defend against in an integrated manner similar to the EU Code for Disinformation discussed above.<sup>258</sup>

Despite the lack of a regional strategy, there are already several efforts underway in the South Pacific to buttress cyber-threat information sharing. For example, as part of Australia’s “International Cyber Engagement Strategy,” the Pacific Cyber Security Operational Network (PaCSON) was established in April 2018.<sup>259</sup> PaCSON is intended to foster cooperation among South Pacific island nations by providing a mechanism to share cybersecurity threat information and defensive tools, techniques and ideas.<sup>260</sup> At its core, PaCSON consists of a network of government-appointed cybersecurity incident response experts from Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.<sup>261</sup> However, there is no existing or planned formal or informal regional structure in the South Pacific dealing with the security of election infrastructure.<sup>262</sup>

*3. Asia*
As with Oceania, democracies across Asia are also dealing with election insecurity and disinformation.<sup>263</sup> While this Article does not seek to fully address the myriad of threats to election infrastructure across Asia, it is worth briefly noting three trends in managing the twin threats of election integrity and disinformation. First, unlike efforts in the U.S., EU, or Australia, Asian democracies have been willing to criminalize the spreading of misinformation. Malaysia, for example, has criminalized the sharing of misinformation.<sup>264</sup> Myanmar and Thailand have leaned on law enforcement actions to reign in misinformation, which have been abused in some cases to silence critics of public corruption.<sup>265</sup>

GROUND MEDIA (Apr. 23, 2019), https://perma.cc/BG89-JPZ8 (noting fears that Thailand’s military junta would use combating misinformation on social media as a screen for increased censorship of political dissent).

Second, there has been focused attention on this issue from the highest levels of national leadership. In Indonesia, for example, President Joko Widodo spearheaded the creation of the new National Cyber and Encryption Agency to combat disinformation in their elections.<sup>266</sup> One example was in June 2019, when a member of the Muslim Cyber Army was arrested in Java for posting misinformation to the effect that the Indonesian government was being controlled by China.<sup>267</sup>

Third, it is apparent that more nations are using increasingly heavy-handed tactics to clamp down on internet freedoms in the name of fighting disinformation. The problem of disinformation in India, for example, is so severe that it has been likened to a public health crisis.<sup>268</sup> One Microsoft study, for example, found that 64 percent of Indians encountered disinformation online in 2019, which was the highest proportion among twenty-two surveyed countries.<sup>269</sup> Not only have these incidents affected elections such as by spreading false information about candidates on WhatsApp,<sup>270</sup> but they have led to real-world harms including at least thirty-three deaths and sixty-nine instances of mob violence.<sup>271</sup> In response, the Indian government has shut down the internet more than one hundred times over the past year,<sup>272</sup> and has proposed laws that would give it largely unchecked surveillance powers, mirroring Chinese-style internet censorship.<sup>273</sup>

### *C. Summary*

As is apparent from these case studies and illustrative examples, there is divergent state practice with regards to both the protection of election infrastructure and the use of digital repression. The area of greatest convergence seems to be the recognition that paper ballots, or at the least EVMs using paper trails, are vital to building confidence in the outcome of an election.<sup>274</sup> Fewer jurisdictions that we could identify have taken the next step of requiring risk-limiting audits or have reclassified their election infrastructure or political parties as “critical.”<sup>275</sup> These findings are summarized in Table 2 and are unpacked further in Part V.
