## III. STATE-SPONSORED DOMESTIC TERROR

### A. *Hong Kong*

The increasingly interconnected world means China sometimes cannot easily hide its appalling abuses.<sup>38</sup> The call for human rights protections in China is nothing new, although there are increasing signs the need is becoming acute.<sup>39</sup> The fact that President Xi Jinping has overseen a deterioration in human rights coinciding with a rise in his own power had led some analysts to make comparisons to Mao Zedong.<sup>40</sup> The U.S. can and should engage China on its deplorable human rights record. Following China’s repression in Hong Kong, President Trump signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act<sup>41</sup> which stripped the city of its special trading

status with the U.S. The measure was necessary due to a new security law imposed by Beijing, which meant Hong Kong was no longer sufficiently autonomous from China to justify special treatment.<sup>42</sup> Essentially, the security law undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy and increased the risk of sensitive U.S. technology and intellectual property being illegally diverted to unauthorized end users in China and elsewhere.”<sup>43</sup> Speaking of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, President Trump asserted that the law provided his administration with the necessary tools to hold responsible the individuals and entities that extinguished the flame of freedom in Hong Kong.<sup>44</sup> In his address, President Trump equated the devolution in Hong Kong civil rights and liberties with a newfound inability to compete in free markets.<sup>45</sup> If President Trump is correct, China’s determination to continually oppress peoples will have longitudinal real-world economic consequences.

### B. *Tragedy in Xinjiang*

Beyond the imposition of a police state in Hong Kong, recent events in Xinjian, China’s westernmost province, ought to shock the world’s conscience and bring condemnation upon China for human rights abuses against the Uyghur ethnic minority. Xinjiang, officially the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, is home to approximately 11 million Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic

minority that speaks a language similar to Turkish and has a unique culture.<sup>46</sup> Uyghur history is complex. The territory was the easternmost edge of the medieval Islamic Empire.<sup>47</sup> During the tenth century, the population converted to Islam from Buddhism and Christianity. Many centuries later, in 1759, the Manchus invaded their domain and “blanketed the area with colonial non-Muslim administration and limited the Islamic authority to a secondary position.”<sup>48</sup> In the twentieth century, various governments imposed regulations to further isolate the Uyghurs from Islam. In the 1970s, however, China implemented its open-door policy<sup>49</sup> and enabled the Uyghurs to restore their mosques, organize Hajj pilgrimages, and attend Islamabad universities to study Islam.<sup>50</sup> An Islamic renaissance flowered from 1978 to 1988 but Beijing came to view these developments as a threat to state secular authoritarianism. Forbidden for decades to practice Islam, the Uyghurs have since been subjected to Chinese coercion methods, including the depiction of Uyghur resistance as international terrorism.<sup>51</sup> Since 2016, China interned at least one million Uyghurs in concentration camps it euphemistically calls “reeducation centers” or “vocational training and education centers.”<sup>52</sup> In actuality, the centers are concentration camps, designed to brainwash Uyghurs and force them to abandon their heritage and religion.<sup>53</sup> The detainees are abused, tortured,

Not content with twentieth-century-style concentration camps, China is hard-wiring Xinjiang for segregated surveillance.<sup>60</sup> Applying military style cyber capabilities to civilian control, the Chinese government created a “virtual cage” that complements the physical concentration camps in Xianjing.<sup>61</sup> To enable surveillance, Xinjiang operates under a grid management system: municipal centers are divided into squares of about 500 people and each square has an assigned police unit that monitors inhabitants by regularly scanning their identification cards, faces and bodies, DNA samples, and cell phones.<sup>62</sup> In the Uyghur city of Kashgar, the police rely on an app to flag people exhibiting suspicious behavior, such as atypical smartphone use, avoiding the front door, coming and going from home or refueling someone else’s vehicle.<sup>63</sup> Human Rights Watch claims the government’s arbitrary power is reflected in the app which is designed “to consider vague, broad categories of behaviors, many of them perfectly legal, as indicators of suspiciousness.”<sup>64</sup> Wang Lixiong, a Chinese author who has written about China’s surveillance state in Xinjiang explains that the “goal here is instilling fear – fear that their surveillance technology can see into every corner of your life.”<sup>65</sup> The company behind the technology is the China Electronics Technology Group Corp., or CETC, a state-owned defense contractor.<sup>66</sup> China began its intense

### D. *Opportunity Wasted*

On June 17, 2020, President Trump signed the bipartisan Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act.<sup>69</sup> The Act is intended to hold Chinese officials accountable and imposes sanctions on foreign individuals and entities responsible for human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Additionally, the statute requires reports to Congress on several topics, including the Chinese government’s acquisition and development of technology to facilitate internment and mass surveillance. So far so good. Yet undermining the significant moral dimensions of the law were a series of bombshell allegations leveled at President Trump by his former National Security Advisor John Bolton.

*White House Memoir,* Bolton insists President Trump told President Xi Jinping he endorsed Beijing’s Uyghur concentration camps.<sup>71</sup> Bolton noted that “Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do … which meant we could cross repression of the Uyghurs off our list of possible reasons to sanction China, at least as long as trade negotiations continued.”<sup>72</sup> By President Trump’s own admission, he initially prioritized the making of a trade deal with China over punishing Beijing for mistreating the Uyghurs.<sup>73</sup> President Trump’s detractors insist this was no one-off as his record, in their view, shows a selective approach to human rights issues; regions where President Trump is looking to “make a deal” are unlikely to face sanctions.<sup>74</sup> For their part, China hawks privately expressed frustration because they believe President Trump did not need The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act because the Global Magnitsky Act already provided him with the authority to impose U.S. lawful entry and property sanctions against any foreign person or entity for reasons including extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.<sup>75</sup> From this
