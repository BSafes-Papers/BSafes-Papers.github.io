## *III. U.S. Efforts to Protect Democratic Institutions*

When adversaries interfere with elections, they threaten more than the integrity of electoral process, they threaten collective faith in democracy. Indeed, a core focus of the Russian strategy to undermine confidence in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was not necessarily to target voting machines directly, but instead to use low-cost techniques through social media and otherwise to “undermine and distract the Clinton campaign,” which would, to Russia’s delight, result in a benefit to Donald Trump’s campaign.<sup>107</sup> This is why so many state and private actors have taken action in response to Russia’s “sweeping and systematic” interference in both U.S. and European elections, and why it is so surprising that the U.S. federal government did not take more comprehensive and decisive action to counter this ongoing threat ahead of the 2020 election cycle.<sup>108</sup> This section summarizes attempts within the U.S.’s public and private sectors to improve election security. It concludes by identifying particular weaknesses in the overall U.S. response to date, while Part V offers a series of steps for how to fill these governance gaps.

### *A. U.S. Efforts to Safeguard its Election Infrastructure*

This section begins by discussing federal and state protections for voting infrastructure. We next move on to analyze companion efforts from civil society and the private sector. After that, we explore U.S. efforts to combat digital repression and then offer several critiques of U.S. efforts to make democracy harder to hack.

#### *1. Federal & State Approaches to Election Security*

In the United States, elections are primarily administered by the states.<sup>109</sup> Unlike other countries with federal governments, such as Australia explored in Part IV, the U.S. federal government has historically played a minimal role in election oversight.<sup>110</sup> Yet, as the Congressional Research Service has noted, “the federal government . . . has steadily increased its presence in campaigns and elections in the past fifty years. Altogether, dozens of congressional committees and federal agencies could be involved in federal elections under current law.”<sup>111</sup> As a result, there is a patchwork of voting systems throughout the country, with many states—including core swing states like Pennsylvania—using outdated voting machines and, as of August 2019, more than ten using paperless ballots, which leave no paper trail preventing an effective post-election audit in the aftermath of a cyber-attack.<sup>112</sup> While the federal government can regulate aspects of federal voting and appropriate funds for state voting systems<sup>113</sup> along with, of course, providing for the common defense,<sup>114</sup> the political response at the federal level can, as of this writing, at best be described as apathetic to election security concerns.<sup>115</sup>

Congress did appropriate $380 million for state election security efforts after the 2016 election,<sup>116</sup> along with another $425 million in December 2019.<sup>117</sup> These are steps in the right direction, and are in line broadly with how much it would cost to replace paperless voting machines across the nation, and will allow more states to upgrade their voting equipment and conduct post-election audits.<sup>118</sup> Yet these appropriations did not stem from any authority created in the aftermath of the 2016 election.119 Instead, these were part of a 2002 bill, the Help America Vote Act,120 passed as a consequence of the contested presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000.<sup>121</sup> Multiple bills, some bipartisan, were subsequently proposed and passed by one of the two chambers of Congress, but thus far all have stalled.<sup>122</sup> In particular, the most widely reported on bill, the Election Security Act, would have pushed states to implement back-up paper ballots and would have provided $1 billion in election security grants for modernization.<sup>123</sup> However, Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, argued that such a bill would federalize the election process and take control away from states.<sup>124</sup>

The Senate Intelligence Committee released a report in 2019 on the 2016 election and provided recommendations for securing elections.<sup>125</sup> These recommendations—including the need for paper ballots—have yet to be implemented in any concerted way.<sup>126</sup> In addition, a widely disseminated report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, entitled *Securing the Vote*, put together a series of recommendations, which included: election administrators“routinely assess[ing] the integrity of voter registration databases,” ensuring backups for pollbooks should disruptions occur, conducting regular penetration testing, requiring paper ballots along with post-election audits and the removal of“[v]oting machines that do not provide the capacity for independent auditing,” and empowering the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) to “develop security standards and verification and validation protocols for electronic pollbooks in addition to the standards and verification and validation protocols they have developed for voting systems.”<sup>127</sup> However, most of these recommendations have similarly not been acted upon as of this writing.<sup>128</sup>

As a matter of national defense, election security has received more attention at the federal level through agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Security Agency, and Federal Bureau of Investigation.<sup>129</sup> Most notably, DHS designated the election infrastructure<sup>130</sup> as critical infrastructure.<sup>131</sup> This means that DHS can offer states resources and intelligence insights to ensure election security.<sup>132</sup> It does not mean, however, the same degree of regulatory oversight as is common in other jurisdictions, such as the European Union discussed in Part IV. Despite a multitude of efforts, the pains taken by various U.S. agencies and departments have been relatively ad hoc and siloed.<sup>133</sup> This is likely why the Director of National Intelligence established the position of Intelligence Community Election Threats Executive (ETE) in July of 2019.<sup>134</sup> The goal of that position is to coordinate election security activities across the federal government.<sup>135</sup> Another useful step in this same vein has been the creation of Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC) to help share information about cyber threats and best practices with election agencies and other interested stakeholders.<sup>136</sup> But it is still unclear whether such coordination will ultimately address the problems associated with election insecurity in the United States, to say nothing of other vulnerable democracies.

At the state level, many state and local governments have organized and funded their own initiatives to improve election security in the absence of effective federal leadership.<sup>137</sup> For example, California created the Office of Elections Cybersecurity.<sup>138</sup> Virginia switched from paperless electronic voting to a statewide paper ballot system.<sup>139</sup> Colorado instituted a risk-limiting audit that is being emulated by other states.<sup>140</sup> Indiana passed a plan to phase out paperless voting machines fully by 2029.<sup>141</sup> In total, as of this writing at least thirty-six states have made efforts to improve and are working with DHS or the National Guard to assess and identify voting systems.<sup>142</sup> However, wait times for help, especially with DHS, are reportedly very long (up to nine months), and with state and local elections happening multiple times per year, it is likely that vulnerabilities will go unaddressed for several more election cycles.<sup>143</sup>

#### *2. Private Sector & Civil Society Efforts*
In the United States (and unlike Australia, as we will see), election security has very deep ties with the private sector and is a topic watched closely, but largely passively, by civil society organizations and academia.<sup>144</sup> The private sector plays such a strong role because voting machines are manufactured without direct government involvement and are only subject to ex post testing.<sup>145</sup> Thus, among the first lines of defense of election infrastructure security lies primarily in the hands of private voting machine manufacturers, who despite the various stress tests required by many states, produce equipment that may still contain vulnerabilities that can go undetected.<sup>146</sup> While manufacturers have taken steps to boost election infrastructure security, such as by refusing to sell paperless machines to those jurisdictions that do not have paper voting machines as their primary machines, machines continue to be in operation without any serious recall regime in place and there are no legal obligations to notify election officials when vulnerabilities and breaches are detected.<sup>147</sup> “I know America’s voting machines are vulnerable,” said J. Alex Halderman during Congressional testimony, “because my colleagues and I have hacked them—repeatedly—as part of a decade of research studying the technology that operates elections and learning how to make it stronger.”<sup>148</sup> He has gone on to argue: “Our highly computerized election infrastructure is vulnerable to sabotage and even to cyberattacks that could change votes.”<sup>149</sup>

Halderman demonstrated, for example, how a mock contest between George Washington and Benedict Arnold could be won by the latter, simply by infecting a voting machine’s memory with malware.<sup>150</sup> The vulnerabilities that Halderman and his group have exploited include not only outdated voting machines, but also election-management systems that design ballots, which election officials often access via memory cards that may be corrupted.<sup>151</sup> Other cybersecurity researchers have corroborated these findings, including those affiliated with the Defcon hacker conference, and found numerous vulnerabilities in many voting machines still in use across more than twenty-six states in 2019.<sup>152</sup>

Within civil society and academia, numerous comprehensive reports on election security have been written exploring what to do about these problems.<sup>153</sup> The most notable of these publications include the National Academies of Sciences’ Securing the Vote mentioned above; the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law’s Defending Elections; and the Center for American Progress’s Election Security in All 50 States. <sup>154</sup> However, once again, because of political stagnation, there has been very little implementation of their policy proposals.<sup>155</sup> As for active participation in election security, some universities play a role in certifying and testing voting machines, but this role is limited.<sup>156</sup>

### *B. U.S. Attempts to Combat Digital Repression*

Unlike the tentative steps that have been taken to protect U.S. election infrastructure, the U.S. government’s response to misinformation remains nascent, which is in part due to demanding requirements of the First Amendment and deep divisions about the proper role of the federal government in policing content.<sup>157</sup> There are, however, a patchwork of state laws aimed at combatting the effects of misinformation.<sup>158</sup>One example is a California law that requires the state’s Department of Education to provide a list of education materials on its websites to teach students how to distinguish misinformation from real news and advertisements.<sup>159</sup> The impetus behind the law was a Stanford University study,<sup>160</sup> which found that 82 percent of middle school students could not distinguish between advertisements and news stories.<sup>161</sup> Other states have followed suit, by including more programming related to misinformation and disinformation in their educational programming.<sup>162</sup>

Congress has unsuccessfully tried to pass the Honest Ads Act,<sup>163</sup> a bill that requires platform political ads to follow the same rules as the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, such as identifying the organization or person sponsoring the ad.<sup>164</sup> In addition, the Act would require platforms to engage in“reasonable efforts” to ensure that ads are not purchased“directly or indirectly” by foreign governments.<sup>165</sup> Major tech companies have strongly opposed such a bill, arguing instead for self-regulation.<sup>166</sup> Some, such as Twitter, have come out with new limits—and even bans—on political ads on their platforms due, in part, to concerns over enabling the spread of misinformation,<sup>167</sup> but as of this writing Facebook has not followed suit.<sup>168</sup>

### *C. Critiques of U.S. Response*
While there are many efforts afoot within the public and private sectors to improve the security of U.S. election infrastructure and combat digital repression, as the foregoing analysis made clear there remains a great deal to be done. Consider the work done at Defcon since 2017 that was referenced above.169 Defcon is the world’s largest “white hat”hacker conference, and it reports out the numerous ways its participants have been able to hack into U.S. voting machines annually.<sup>170</sup> In its 2018 report, conference participants found, among other vulnerabilities, that: (1) a tabulator used by twenty-three states could be hacked via a network attack; (2) a machine used in eighteen states was able to be hacked within two minutes, which is remarkable considering that it takes the average voter six minutes to vote; and (3) hackers had the ability to wirelessly reprogram an electronic card used by many Americans to activate the voting terminal.<sup>171</sup> The latter issue would allow a single voter to cast multiple ballots in a given voting session.<sup>172</sup> As Senator Ron Wyden said at Defcon in 2019, “Election officials across the country as we speak are buying election systems that will be out of date the moment they open the box.”<sup>173</sup> He added: “[This is] the election security equivalent of putting our military out there to go up against superpowers with a peashooter.”<sup>174</sup>

The vulnerabilities exposed at Defcon stem from the lack of comprehensive federal and state oversight discussed above. Leaving voting machine hardware and software to the private sector without adequate regulatory oversight is insufficient to protect election security.<sup>175</sup> Moreover, the failure of effective federal oversight has meant a greater burden on state and local officials, who often do not have the expertise necessary to compare and assess the quality of voting systems when making purchasing decisions. <sup>176</sup> Some with the means and will, such as Los Angeles, with its $300 million Voting Solutions for All People program, have taken it upon themselves to make major investments in new technology and practices, but these are outliers.<sup>177</sup> Furthermore, many state and local governments remain insufficiently trained to respond to cybersecurity threats<sup>178</sup> and still more jurisdictions are using voter databases that are over a decade old—a lifetime in tech terms.<sup>179</sup> The continued weakness of the U.S. response leaves election security a “significant counterintelligence threat,”<sup>180</sup> which adversaries may continue to exploit, along with abusing social media firms with lax policies to combat digital repression.<sup>181</sup>

The United States is not alone in facing these vulnerabilities, though. Both advanced and emerging democracies around the world are similarly grappling with how best to enhance the security and integrity of their own elections and democratic societies. Part IV focuses on some of these efforts, notably from the European Union, Asia, Australia, and Oceania. Implications for policymakers stemming from this analysis are explored in Part V.
