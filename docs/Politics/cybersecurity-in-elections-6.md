## Annex A: Case studies
A series of case study interviews with EMBs and security agencies from around the world were conducted for this publication. Some of these interviews are reflected in the following country case studies. Other interviews were used to provide additional background information and details. The interviews were structured by the following themes:

- overview of institution and use of ICTs; 

- definition of cyber-risks in elections; 

- overview of cyber-risks for election-related systems and processes; 

- actors involved in protecting elections against cyberattacks; and 

- coordinated cooperation between the relevant actors.

### Australia

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is responsible for conducting federal elections and referendums and maintaining the Australian Commonwealth electoral roll. Australia has 151 electoral divisions, each of which is represented by a member of the House of Representatives. Divisional offices manage the electoral roll, carry out public awareness activities and administer elections.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The AEC has a history of effectively implementing legislative change that requires the use of technology, while maintaining the integrity of the electoral system. It trialled electronic voting for certain groups, including blind and low-vision voters, in the 2007 federal election. This evolved into the current method of telephone voting for these groups.

Currently, the AEC uses various IT systems, ranging from legacy, 20-year-old mainframes to modern cloud-based services. It is responsible for:

- a highly scalable website (from 20 hits between elections to 20 million on election day); 

- ballot scanners operated by third-party providers at a counting centre in each state to count the complex preferential ballots; 

- a data transmission and tabulation system; 

- a voter registration system (hosted by a third-party provider) used to create voter rolls and share voter data with political parties; and

- electronic certified lists in selected locations to find and mark voters off the electoral roll.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
A priority for the AEC is to protect its IT systems—particularly those related to counting votes and transmitting data—and the overall electoral process from integrity challenges. Manual procedures, including a paper count, are always possible and available as a backup plan for a worst-case scenario.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
The Australian Government places a high priority on its cybersecurity policy. It provides standard policies and a security manual for protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of government data and IT systems in its Protective Security Policy Framework (Australian Government AttorneyGeneral’s Department n.d.).

This high standard is not specific to elections; it covers information security in digital and hard copy format as well as physical and personal security. Applying this standard, the AEC treats cyber-risks in the same way as other government entities. Therefore it has a dedicated IT security advisor as part of its Information Security and Governance unit.

Following increasing global concerns, Australia established an Electoral Integrity Task Force in May 2018 to shore up its processes for upcoming byelections and to inform future federal elections. The task force brings together a range of agencies—the AEC, state and territorial EMBs, the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Cybersecurity Centre, the Department of Communications and security agencies. It has assessed vulnerabilities related to elections and electoral processes. The task force seeks to:

- develop a shared understanding of vulnerabilities and how they evolve between elections; 

- conduct risk assessments and make related suggestions; 

- clarify the role, coordination and leadership between participating agencies; 

- advise the AEC and state and territorial EMBs on risk mitigation; 

- coordinate the monitoring of social media; and 

- develop a joint communications strategy.

Additionally, the Council of Australian Governments has asked that cyberrelated ‘health’ checks are conducted on all Australian electoral commissions. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of the Australian Parliament raised the classification of Australia’s  electoral systems as national critical infrastructure as an important matter for inquiry (Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia 2019).

The AEC also maintains ongoing communications with social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google to inform management of electoral messaging.

### Austria

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
In Austria, elections are managed in a mixed system: an independent Federal Electoral Board (Commission) works with the Federal Ministry of Interior. The different levels of election administration include the federal electoral board, provincial electoral boards, district electoral boards, municipality electoral boards and a special electoral board. Local administrations are responsible for all election operations.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The voting process is paper based with manual counts and paper reports. As soon as the polling station is closed the preliminary reports are transmitted via phone, email or text message. These preliminary data are stored on a Ministry of Interior server. These data are not legally binding, but need to be protected from disclosure before voting ends at the last polling station. The digital result figures are compared with provincial reports and the preliminary final results are published on the Internet and announced by the minister. All software is constantly improved and modernized, and the system is tested before every election.

A new centralized electronic voter register was launched in 2018. It facilitates improved data quality and online participation and signing of public initiatives. Municipalities are still responsible for maintaining the local voter registers, but all data are stored on a centralized platform. The added convenience of online participation led to increased interest and unprecedented demand for signing public initiatives.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
The electronic transmission of results consists of ad hoc reports that are not legally binding. The Constitutional Court ruled that only paper minutes are legally relevant for determining the final result. However, even problems with preliminary results may raise doubts: the results publication website led to some discussion when glitches made test data publicly available before election day.

A few days after its launch, the online public initiative system became inaccessible for many users. While the problem was fixed quickly, it triggered a parliamentary inquiry, which established that there were no external (cyber) threats of attacks. It was rather the unexpectedly high interest and load on this new online system that led to very slow response times, but never a full collapse of the system.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
Interagency collaboration takes place via Austria’s  national election network, which was constituted in November 2018. The network covers agencies with mandates related to elections (through the Ministry of Interior, Federal Electoral Board and Foreign Ministry); cybersecurity and network security (through the Federal Chancellery and Ministry of Interior); cyber defence (through the Ministry of Defence); media law, election campaigning and political parties (through the Federal Chancellery); registers and cybercrime (through the Ministry of Interior); online services and digital issues (through the Ministry for Digital Matters); data protection and criminal law (through the Ministry for Constitution, Reform and Justice); and European law and institutional issues (through the Foreign Ministry). The Ministry of Interior serves as the network’s national point of contact for the EU.

### Bulgaria

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
Elections in Bulgaria are administered by a three-level structure of EMBs: the Central Election Commission (CEC), 31 district election commissions and approximately 12,000 precinct election commissions.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
Voter lists are extracted from the national population register maintained by the Civil Registration and Administration Services Department of the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works.

The CEC creates and maintains websites and various registers, and maintains the email system used by the various levels of election administration as well as a system for submitting electronic applications for out-of-country voting. It also enables electronic data exchange for voters and candidates between Bulgaria and other EU member states. It further operates an electronic system for approving pre-printed samples of paper ballots, for electronic results processing and transmission for out-of-country voting.

The election law provides for paper and machine voting. During the 2016 presidential election, machine voting was conducted for the first time at 500 polling stations and the results were official. An experimental machine vote count was also conducted. A pilot of remote electronic (Internet) voting was initiated on 1 January 2018 under the responsibility of the CEC. Preliminary voter lists are required to be posted for public scrutiny at polling stations and on municipality websites at least 40 days  before an election. Lastly, the National Audit Office makes campaign-related bank transactions publicly available on its website.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
Following an inventory check of election-related ICT, the CEC adopted a cyberrisk management methodology to identify the possible impact of the risk on the election process, the probability of such risks and remediation measures. This information is updated immediately before an election. The main technical risks covered in the methodology include:

- DDoS—in 2013 and 2015 the commission’s public infrastructure was attacked on an unprecedented scale; 

- leaks of voters’/candidates’ personal data (potential threat); 

- insufficient competence of election commissions at various levels; 

- change of data and content by users with administrative access, by mistake or deliberate; 

- fake news (potential threat); and 

- information security breach of publicly available resources through attacks involving content change/substitution, including hacking individual machines, attacks leading to equipment malfunctioning, and manipulation of data during transfer and result processing as potential threats, especially after the introduction of remote e-voting and machine voting.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
To protect the election process, the CEC collaborates with a wide range of partners in public administration and technology companies. Bulgaria’s  egovernment and information security operations are contracted to the State eGovernment Agency and resources of the Ministry of Interior, the State Agency for National Security and other bodies.

The main technological partner of the CEC is the state-owned company Information Services JSC. JSC experts are in charge of the CEC’s  critical infrastructure and the development and implementation of computer processing of the results and online attendance when elections are held.

The CEC is responsible for coordinating between all relevant actors, including during an incident. At the national level, an interservice group is chaired by the deputy prime minister, which coordinates and plans the activities before, during and after election day.

Before each election, the public prosecutor general and the minister of interior set up joint headquarters (teams) for operational interaction in the fight against election-related (including cyber) crimes. These teams are operational during the entire pre-election campaign and on election day.

The CEC and its technological partner are continuously improving the cyberprotection methods and technologies. ICT centres for processing election results data are physically independent environments, which prevents external interference during processing operations. The public systems are backed up several times: they are equipped with modern cyberprotection systems and monitored 24/7 by information security experts. The organization’s measures for preventing cyberattacks cover the parties directly participating in an election and other relevant parties such as national Internet providers and telecommunication operators, transmission system operators, etc.

A large-scale public information campaign is organized during in the run-up to elections. Regular briefings are conducted, and close cooperation is established with the media in effort to prevent fake news campaigns.

### Canada

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
Headed by the chief electoral officer of Canada, Elections Canada is an independent, non-partisan parliamentary agency responsible for administering the Canada Elections Act. The agency’s mandate is to:

- be prepared at all times to conduct a federal general election, by-election or referendum; 

- administer the political financing provisions of the Canada Elections Act; 

- monitor compliance with electoral legislation; 

- conduct public information campaigns on voter registration, voting and becoming a candidate; 

- conduct education programmes for students on the electoral process; 

- provide support to the independent commissions in charge of adjusting the boundaries of federal electoral districts following each decennial census; 

- carry out studies on alternative voting methods and, with the approval of parliamentarians, test alternative voting processes for future use during electoral events; and 

- provide assistance and cooperation in electoral matters to electoral agencies in other countries or to international organizations.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
For federal elections, Canada relies on paper ballots that are hand marked by voters and hand counted by officials in some 25,000 different polling stations across the country. This process is observed by scrutineers from each of the major political parties. The election administration is highly decentralized and paper based so documents can be verified after each election. Electronic voting systems are also used. Elections Canada uses new technology to:

- manage electronic networks and intranets at headquarters and in the field to enable communications; 

- maintain and improve applications supporting the National Register of Electors and the Electoral Geography Database, as well as several other tools that support real-time monitoring of (and reporting on) electoral events; 

- develop and expand the agency’s social media presence; 

- create customized applications that support key services, such as the Voter Information Service, real-time broadcasting of election results and online reporting for political entities; 

- develop and support customized applications that enable political parties, electoral district associations, candidates, nomination contestants and leadership contestants to complete and submit the financial returns required by the Canada Elections Act; and 

- maintain an Online Voter Registration Service, launched in 2012, which offers an alternative way for citizens to check and update their registration status.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
At the federal level, errors in result transmission or attacks against result publication websites may happen, but the results are always verifiable through the paper trail and not even the most sophisticated cyberattack could tamper with them. Local elections are more exposed to cyberthreats, since more technology such as ballot scanners, tabulators and online voting systems is used.

Canada is not immune to attacks designed to suppress the number of people who vote or manipulate how they vote. So far, the only documented attack was the 2011 Robocall scandal, in which thousands of voters in almost 250 ridings across the country reported receiving automated phone messages falsely telling them that their polling station had been changed. Elections Canada’s investigations attributed these calls to domestic political actors.

The Canadian Government has tasked the Canadian Communications Security Establishment (CSE) with assessing the cyberthreats to the country’s democratic process (CSE 2017) and advising parties on best practices to protect themselves from cyberthreats and to safeguard their databases of personal voter information.

The CSE details three key cyberthreats:

- registering voters: attacks against systems determining who is eligible to vote; 

- voting: attacks against systems for receiving, counting and recording the votes; and

- disseminating results: attacks against systems for informing the public of the election results.

The CSE assessment pointed to mostly unsophisticated and low-level attacks in past elections, and highlighted political parties, individual politicians and the media as being the most vulnerable. It expects more (and more sophisticated) attacks in future elections. The assessment concluded that multiple groups will very likely deploy cyber-related capabilities in an attempt to influence the democratic process during the 2019 federal election. This prompted Elections Canada to enhance its cybersecurity posture by improving the security design of its IT network and procuring a new data-hosting service that will offer a range of additional protections, all in consultation with the CSE.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
The minister of democratic institutions is responsible for leading the government’s efforts to defend the democratic process from cyberthreats, together with the CSE, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and Public Safety Canada, among others.

In June 2018, the Government of Canada announced the creation of the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity, which aims to offer a unified approach to cybersecurity and enable faster, better-coordinated and more focused government responses to cyberthreats (which may or may not be election related). Elections Canada works with these security partners to stay up to date on the threat environment. Additionally, the Election Integrity Office, which was established following the 2011 Robocall incident, assesses domestic and international cyberthreats, and aims to prevent them.

Elections Canada coordinates with other government organizations that have mandates related to election security: the commissioner of Canada Elections, the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Public Safety Canada and Canada’s national security advisor.

The delivery of trusted/secure elections is a joint undertaking involving Elections Canada, security agencies, political participants, the media, private industry and civil society. The efforts span four complementary layers of assurance and collaboration:

- 1.National security and emergency management, which entails defending Canada against a range of security threats/events including foreign interference and intrusion. The key initiatives are:

  - briefings to political parties and federal/provincial elections officials on threats to electoral processes in Canada;

  - meetings with foreign security and intelligence partners to discuss their efforts and experience;

  - establishing relationships with social media companies;

  - intelligence assessments including the CSE’s 2017 report, *Cyberthreats to Canada’s Democratic Process;* and 
  
  - various planning and simulation exercises.

- 2.Democratic institutions, which involves building the resilience of the country’s democratic institutions in the context of emerging threats to ensure whole-of-government coordinated action. The key initiative is the passage of the Elections Modernization Act (Bill C-76) in 2018. The bill includes measures that aim to make the electoral process more secure, including by:

  - strengthening the third-parties’ regime;

  - adding prohibitions related to the use of foreign funds;

  - giving additional powers to the commissioner of Canada Elections;

  - expanding existing provisions against certain types of online impersonation and false statements; and

  - requiring social media platforms to publish and preserve archives of election and partisan ads.

- 3.Electoral security, which entails joint efforts to ensure the security of the electoral process. EMB independence is positioned within joint activities and key initiatives:

  - Joint Steering Committee (EMB and lead security agencies)— meets monthly;
  
  - mandates clarified
  
  - interagency collaboration/mutual support instituted;

  - protection of electoral infrastructure strengthened; and

  - outreach to political parties/social media ongoing

 Planned initiatives:

  - finalization/testing of Incident Management Plan;

  - conduct of various planning and training exercises;

  - finalization of communications strategy; and

  - reinforcement of trusted sources of information.

- 4.EMB security, which consists of joint work with security partners to strengthen EMB infrastructure and security posture. Key initiatives include:

  - Electoral Integrity and Disinformation team in place; 

  - enhanced systems’ security and systems’ monitoring; 

  - launch of security awareness, including field operations; 

  - security governance and plan improved; 

  - collection/sharing EMB best practices; meetings with political parties; and

  - engaged social media platforms and establishing communication channels to quickly respond to incidents.

  Planned initiatives:

  - continue to establish Elections Canada as a trusted source of information on when, where and how to register and vote; 

  - planning/training exercises completed, including election simulation; and

  - social media monitoring.

  The overall target is to:

  - keep voting simple and convenient and to make basic cyberhygiene accessible to all;

  - sustain discussion with political parties and civil society to recognize the political economy of cybersecurity, avoid politicizing electoral security, and manage public and political expectations; and 
  - facilitate communications through a trusted voice and public spokespersons, dealing with the changing media environment and ensuring coherent and seamless support to citizens.

In early 2019 the Government of Canada unveiled its plan to fight disinformation and foreign interference in a multi-pronged approach that involves the Ministry of Democracy Institutions, Defence and Public Safety, and Emergency Preparedness and builds on four pillars: (a) enhancing  citizen preparedness by providing information to the public; (b) improving organizational readiness through improved coordination; (c) combatting foreign interference through security agencies; and (d) expecting social media platforms to help safeguard elections.

Under the Critical Election Incident Protocol, five senior public servants decide when an incident is serious enough to warrant informing the public during the official campaign period. Their decision will be based on information provided by the national security agencies.

### Denmark

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
In Denmark, elections are managed by three levels of administration: the Election Section (ES) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Interior (MoEAI), 92 district  election committees and some 1,400 polling district election committees. The ES is a permanent body that is responsible for organizing elections. Some ES staff are appointed by the MoEAI to a separate entity, the election board, that performs specific tasks such as registering non-parliamentary political parties that want to contest the elections and maintaining a list of party names, as well as deciding on the eligibility of voters who have resided abroad for more than four years. Staff of the Danish Civil Registration System extract voter registers from the national civil registration system, which contains basic personal information on all residents who have a civil registration number. The MoEAI is responsible for this register.

Subject to a maximum term of four years, Denmark has no fixed date for national parliamentary elections. The prime minister calls an election, which is generally held three weeks later. Party registration in practice needs to be finalized before the election is called.

The MoEAI has responsibility for the election process itself. The wider election integrity agenda—which includes illegal social media activities, cybersecurity and cooperation with political parties—is the responsibility of the Ministries of Justice and Defence.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
All ballots are hand counted on election night, and a full manual central recount is conducted the next day. District-level vote counts are entered into the election management system (created by a private vendor) and then transferred to Statistics Denmark. For further safeguards, all district-level vote counts are phoned in to Statistics Denmark on election night. The EMB has a fully functional redundant seat allocation calculation. A vote share deviation indicator is also used as a statistical model outlining the probability of the truthfulness of any deviations. It indicates where to look for possible manipulation and errors. 

The ES works with three bodies that utilize IT systems:

- the National Registry, which compiles the voter lists; 

- private vendors that provide elections technology; and

- Statistics Denmark, which is responsible for collecting the results.

Each of these bodies has its own cybersecurity responsibility; however, if there are any problems the public will look to the ES for a response.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
The decentralized structure of election administration and the largely paper-based process are seen as strengths that make influencing an entire election difficult. One challenge is that local administrations bear considerable responsibility for securing the logistical aspects of elections, including the procurement of systems, but do not always have the necessary capacity or ability to collaborate, for example when assessing their risks. If a threat occurs at the municipal level, the minister will be held accountable by the general public, even if he or she is not responsible. While there is a central manual for conducting elections in local administrations, there are no centralized cybersecurity instructions or guidelines. In 2018, the ES started sending out a letter to warn each municipality about cybersecurity threats.

Although it is hard to disturb elections due to their decentralized and offline nature, a primary concern is the (unfounded) loss of voter trust in the electoral process. Public perceptions are therefore the primary concern, and voter information about how elections work and are secured is important. This information is communicated via both traditional media and social media and helps to kill any rumours that may arise.

The most significant technology-related risks are the defacing of public websites of election-related agencies and major hacks against the providers of key infrastructure including the civil registry and the election management system.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
The Danish EMB has no budgetary control over elections; it is only responsible for the legal framework. The municipalities allocate their own budgets and decide about their technology and vendor contracts.

In recent years it has become apparent that there is a need to increase resilience against cyberthreats and to communicate this resilience to the public. The cybersecurity strategy has three aims: (a) to  identify; (b) to  detect; and (c) to manage and prevent cyberattacks and breakdowns.

On the initiative of the ES, a new inter-ministerial task force was created in 2016 that is coordinated by the Ministry of Justice and includes the Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Defence, the Internal Security Service, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the MoEAI (which participates as the election authority) as well as local administrations. The Ministry of Culture plays an auxiliary role as it is responsible for media regulation.

The fact that the initiative came from within instead of in response to media or political pressure has helped to ensure strong ownership by (and a willingness to collaborate between) the agencies involved. They also have sufficient budget to cover the extra costs. The cooperation is largely informal; meetings are conducted as needed. The task force is deliberately not much more than a phone list including the right decision-makers (sufficiently senior to make decisions, sufficiently working level to know what is going on) and a non-formalized division of responsibilities. This is based on the belief that there should not be a separate system for crises, since systems and institutions should continue to work as they are.

The main purpose of the meetings is to establish the boundaries of responsibility between the agencies, and to exchange information and establish points of contact well before any crisis erupts. Thinking big, but starting small, is seen as a success factor of the task force. The task force has increased awareness among the responsible agencies about responsibilities in this area, and the relevant institutions have showed a great willingness to cooperate. In September 2018, three Danish ministries published a national election action plan against foreign influence on elections and democracy.

### Estonia

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
In Estonia, elections are overseen by the seven-member Estonian National Election Committee. The State Electoral Office is the country’s top-level EMB. It is institutionally independent but falls under the Chancellery of the Parliament. It conducts elections, and organizes and ascertains the results of Internet voting. It also supervises the activities of election managers and is responsible for the development and management of the technical solutions necessary to organize elections.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The State Electoral Office uses a range of election technologies:
- Internet Voting System—operational since 2005, with about one-third of votes cast electronically from 116 countries.

- Election Information System—operational since 1998 as an electronic tool for managing electoral preparations and processing electoral actors, candidates, statistics and results. However, the official results are still the ones from the paper protocols.

- Electoral Results Webpage—publishes the results and statistics from the Election Information System.

- Voters’ Register—voters have been drawn from the centralized state population register and maintained by the Ministry of Interior since 2000. An Electronic Voters’ Roll (which will allow all polling stations to connect to a single information system) is planned from 2021. The system will draw data from the voter register, but will be the responsibility of the EMB.

Election technologies are part of a broad range of Estonian e-government applications based on public and private sector (energy, telecom, banking) systems. All Estonian citizens carry an electronic ID card to access and use these systems.

While election technologies are the responsibility of the EMB, it is not responsible for electoral campaigns, including social media. However, any illegal social media activities are immediately referred to the police.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
Since the large-scale cyberattacks on Estonia’s  online and e-government infrastructure in 2007, no more major attacks have occurred. However, there have been minor incidents including the creation of fake versions of the Internet voting website and the EMB’s website by political activists. For such incidents close cooperation with the police has ensured a swift reaction.

A main problem in Estonia is not actually hacking or breaching the system, but claiming to be able to hack or breach (any) e-enabled system and therefore undermining trust in elections. Public relations and efficient communication about election technologies are as important as countering actual ICT risks. Countering this threat requires three elements:

• a rigid security system;
• communication of the protection and security measures in place; and
• a fast adjudication process that evaluates the validity of complaints within days (not years).

Quick responses during incidents are critical to maintaining public trust. There is constant collaboration with the police, which removes online disinformation as soon as possible. Estonia’s  Supreme Court adjudicates complaints within seven days from their filing.

A first comprehensive cyber-risk assessment in 2017 (Past 2017) indicated that political parties and candidates are primary targets for cyberattacks. While the cybersecurity of parties and candidates is outside the EMB’s jurisdiction, it has a broader mandate to protect the legitimacy of the election.

In addition, the risk assessment identified three key risk areas:

• all technical systems used in the electoral process;
• risks related to management and cooperation, clear designation of responsibilities; and
• hybrid risks related to information warfare, including on social media, which require a clear communication strategy.

The risk assessment indicated that risk levels rise with the level of election— from low exposure for local elections, to high levels of exposure for national and European elections.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
The Estonian EMB views the integrity of elections as the responsibility of the whole government. Cooperation to secure election technology systems includes both the public and private sector: the State Electoral Office together with the National Electoral Committee, the Republic of Estonia Information System Authority, the Response Department of the Estonian Information System Authority, the Cybersecurity Management Team (CERT Estonia), Cybernetica, and Trust Service Provider (SK ID Solutions). An important security measure is the building of digital hygiene and electronic ID awareness, through which all citizens are encouraged to protect their personal devices and electronic identity.

In Estonia, interagency collaboration takes place through multiple ad hoc task forces and working groups. Splitting collaboration into task forces allows groups to remain small, focused and effective. Task forces work based on personal, professional contacts while working groups are usually conducted between designated representatives of various organizations. Before each election, a number of special groups are formed to tackle specific topics and areas of interest and need. The number and setup of these groups is flexible, based on current events and can be altered if needed. Examples of such groups include:

- The general weekly ICT Working Group is responsible for technologies ranging from information systems, websites to hosting services, etc. The group consists of the EMB, State Information System Authority (SISA) and other relevant authorities on a topic-by-topic basis.

- The Public Relations Weekly Working Group focuses on a clear and unified message about the electoral process and monitoring of messaging around the electoral process, the determination of trigger levels when messages require a response and clarity on how to respond. The group consists of the EMB, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Economics and Communications, the Government Office and SISA.

- The Registries, Voter’s Card and Voting Rolls Working Group is responsible for everything related to voter registration and voter lists. The group consists of the EMB, the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Interior IT Centre and, on some topics, SISA. 

- The Campaign Restrictions Working Group discusses the enforcement of limitations on campaign spending. The group consists of the EMB, Police and Border Guard Board.

- The Voting Abroad Task Force is responsible for the organization and administration of voting from abroad. The group consists of the EMB, Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

- The Internet Voting Task Force is responsible for the organization and administration of Internet voting. It consists of the EMB, SISA, the system developer (Cybernetica), helpline and customer support provider (a thirdparty contractor), and an independent auditor.

Most task forces have developed joint response scenarios. They communicate to the outside world through one dedicated channel, which is usually the EMB’s communication person. Important for the efficient operation of these groups is that they convene meetings between equals of their respective organizations: senior staff meet with senior staff, IT experts meet with IT experts, etc.

The EMB also cooperates with SISA and offers cyberhygiene trainings customized to the needs of political candidates. This includes instructions on using social media, securing accounts, recognizing and preventing phishing attacks, etc. Similar trainings are offered to political parties, including a security review of all their electronic channels and online presence. These trainings and services are not mandatory, but political stakeholders find them very useful. Additional  bilateral cooperation takes place with Denmark, Finland, Latvia and Sweden, and Estonia contributes to EU efforts on cybersecurity in elections.

### European Union

#### Election administration mandate
{: .no_toc}
The organization of elections in EU member states falls strictly under member state sovereignty; the EU only has a weak election mandate. However, in the context of increasing threats, fears of the EU overstepping its boundaries have gradually given way to a realization of the need to increase cooperation.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
Previous cyberattacks have received little public attention. As these attacks became part of the mainstream debate, it became clear that there is a need for standards, for increasing cooperation and to address cyberthreats more broadly than the electoral process. There is also a recognition that a breach in any of the 27 member  states during the European Parliamentary elections can have an impact on the ability of the European Parliament to convene.

In September 2018, the European Commission presented the package ‘Securing  free and fair European elections’  that contains several documents, including a communication, guidance, recommendation and draft regulation. The goal is to increase cybersecurity, and to regulate (online) political campaigning, online transparency, the fight against disinformation and data protection.

The package builds on the EU’s Compendium on Cybersecurity of Election Technology (NIS Cooperation Group 2018); the EU *Code of Practice on Disinformation* (EC 2018d), which sets out self-regulatory practices for online companies; the *Action Plan on Disinformation (EU 2018c); and a Recommendation on Election Cooperation Networks, Online Transparency, Protection against Cybersecurity Incidents and Fighting Disinformation Campaigns in the Context of Elections to the European Parliament* (EC 2018b).

The EU *Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems* (EU 2016) led to the creation of a coordination group among all member states. The group distinguishes between cyberthreats at the *technical level and information operations,* which are often more visible. The coordination group provided a platform for initial cooperation on cybersecurity and elections and the drafting of the compendium.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
In its recommendation on election cooperation networks, the European Commission (EC 2018b) recommends that ‘each Member State should set up a national election network, involving national authorities with competence for electoral matters and authorities in charge of monitoring and enforcing rules related to online activities relevant to the electoral context [...] and also:

- Facilitate the swift, secured exchange of information on issues capable of affecting the elections to the European Parliament including by jointly identifying threats and gaps, sharing findings and expertise, and liaising on the application and enforcement of relevant rules in the online environment.

- Whenever appropriate, in accordance with national law, consult, and cooperate with the relevant national law enforcement authorities. Where appropriate, cooperation between national law enforcement authorities at European level may be facilitated by Europol.

- Member States should provide the necessary support to the networks referred to in point (1) and ensure that they have the necessary means to allow a rapid and secure sharing of information.

- In order to facilitate the sharing of expertise and best practices among Member States including on threats, gaps and enforcement, each Member State should designate a single point of contact.

- Member States should adopt specific technical measures to ensure the availability, authenticity, confidentiality and integrity of election services relying on network and information systems. To guarantee the smooth running of every phase of the election, Member States should adequately protect networks and systems used for registering voter rolls and candidates; collecting, processing and counting votes; publishing and communicating election results to the wider public.

- European and national political parties, foundations and campaign organisations should implement specific and appropriate measures to prevent cyber incidents and protect themselves against cyberattacks.

- Member States should perform a comprehensive assessment of risks associated with the elections to the European Parliament with a view to identifying potential cyber incidents that could affect the integrity of the electoral process. Member States should put in place the necessary procedures to prevent, detect, manage and respond to cyberattacks, aiming to minimise their impact, and guarantee a swift exchange of information at all relevant levels, from technical to operational and political. In order to do so, Member States should make sure that national authorities with competence for electoral matters have adequate resources, including technical equipment and trained personnel, in order to deal with such incidents.

- Member States should engage with third parties, including media, online platforms and information technology providers, in awareness raising activities aimed at increasing the transparency of elections and building trust in the electoral processes.

- In the event of a cyber-incident involving attacks against information systems that target the electoral process, Member States should consider an appropriate criminal law response on the basis of Directive 2013/40/EU on attacks against information systems. Member States should ensure close cooperation between national competent authorities, cybersecurity authorities and law enforcement authorities.’

In March 2019, the European Election Cooperation Network organized a first tabletop exercise to test the EU’s  cybersecurity preparedness ahead of the 2019 European Parliament elections. This exercise (EC 2019) allowed participants to:

- ‘acquire an overview of the level of resilience (in terms of policies adopted, available capabilities and skills) of election systems across the EU, including the level of awareness among other stakeholders (e.g. political parties, electoral campaign organizations and suppliers of relevant IT equipment);

- enhance cooperation between relevant authorities at the national level (including election authorities and other relevant bodies and agencies, such as cybersecurity authorities, Computer Security Incident Response Teams, the Data Protections Authority, authorities dealing with disinformation, cybercrime units, etc.);

- verify EU member states’ capacity to adequately assess the risks related to the cybersecurity of European elections, promptly develop situational awareness and coordinate communication with the public;

- test existing crisis management plans as well as relevant procedures to prevent, detect, manage and respond to cybersecurity attacks and hybrid threats, including disinformation campaigns;

- improve cross-border cooperation and strengthen the link with relevant cooperation groups at the EU level (e.g. Election Cooperation Network, NIS Cooperation Group, Computer Security Incident Response Team Network) in order to improve the capacity to respond in a coordinated manner in the event of cross-border cybersecurity incidents; and 

- identify all other potential gaps as well as adequate risk mitigation measures that should be implemented ahead of European Parliament elections.’

### Finland

#### Structure of the EMB
{: .no_toc}
Finland’s  supreme election authority is the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). Local authorities responsible for elections include 13 electoral district committees and 311 municipal authorities and municipal election committees, as well as election committees in about 2,000 polling stations. Additional election committees are in place in around 500 advance polling stations as well as in institutions such as prisons and hospitals.

A close partner of the MoJ is the Population Registry, from which the election administration obtains the voting registers, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which takes care of the advance voting from abroad. Data protection is a key security concern for all agencies dealing with voter registration.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The Finish Government agencies distinguish the technology they use on two levels:

- Low-level systems are generic software applications that are maintained by a joint agency, in cooperation with outsourcing partners.

- High-level systems are specific systems tailored to each agency. Three companies are involved in running the current set of election-related applications.

Finland’s  Election Data System is the IT system used for most national nationwide elections (except Åland, municipal referendums and Sami’s parliamentary elections). The system consists of five subsystems:

- the Base Data System (management of election districts, election authorities and their users, contact information, polling stations);

- the Voting Right Data System (voter register and related systems for update and analysis);

- the Candidate Data System (parties, candidates, candidate list registration)

- the Result Calculation System (vote tabulation and result calculation); and 

- the Result Reporting System (official reports on election results and various statistics).

The system is owned by the MoJ; its data are jointly owned by the MoJ and the Population Register Centre, and the Legal Register Centre administers and operates the system. The system is custom developed by five companies. It is web based with different user access levels, and most functions are restricted by date and time. A separate system gives voters access to public information. Work on the system started in 2002; it has been in full use since 2012.

Finland conducted an online voting study in 2017 and decided not to adopt the practice, mainly for security reasons, especially regarding the security of the end user devices and the high costs of a secure system. Only the autonomous region Åland conducts online voting as of 2019 for its small population of 30,000, many of them abroad.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
The most critical processes in the system are:
-  the voter lists, due to the sensitive, personal data they contain, directly exported from the population register, combined with the need to make these data available in polling stations as paper copies;

- the result calculation system, used in all voting areas to enter results data; and

- the result publishing system to disseminate the results through separate channels via the MoJ website and media companies.

Cyberthreats against those systems are taken seriously, especially from ideologically motivated attackers who may be very persistent. However, some of the same tools that are used by well-resourced adversaries in advanced persistent threats are also available to bored individuals who may also have the patience and resolution to launch successful attacks. In light of increasing risks, the EMB has received considerable additional funding to set up more secure practices. Safeguards for the system include creating paper records of every critical process that can be verified independently from IT systems.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
Beyond the cooperation with the Population Registry on voter registration, election-related technology is the responsibility of six key organizations:

- the MoJ election unit responsible for overall electoral matters;

- the ICT Service Centre that is directly responsible for the Election Information System;

-  three private ICT service providers contracted by the MoJ;

- the State IT Agency;

- the State Cybersecurity Agency in an advisory role, which analyses threats; and

- the Central Criminal Police, which is responsible for investigations.

Additional cooperation needs to be established with a newly created agency responsible for the central authentication system and electronic identification for the entire government.

Basic coordination between these agencies has been in place for decades. However, starting in 2016 closer cooperation was initiated by the EMB. As elections are now understood to be sensitive to security threats, the Cybersecurity Agency and police are now more closely involved in this cooperation. Elections and other government systems are not defined as critical infrastructure; this designation is mostly used for military contexts.

Additional cooperation with ministries and academia was initiated in 2017 related to the introduction of postal voting and the debate about introducing online voting. While postal voting and a related new ICT system are being introduced, online voting was not universally adopted due to security concerns.

Interagency collaboration takes place in different formats:

- meetings between agencies on multiple topics including cybersecurity that take place at irregular intervals with various agencies attending as needed;

- a continuously updated risk overview and related mitigation measures, based on threat assessments and intelligence—a specific cyberassessment, including ongoing international developments, is conducted for each election;

- development of plans to handle crisis events involving all parties, including investigation capacity; and

- exercises and simulated scenarios (mostly tabletop exercises) analysing scenarios step by step, clarifying responsibilities, preparing investigations and handling incidents.

Most of this collaboration is informal, with little published information. Written records of activities are only provided to the minister of justice. The security sector does not necessarily agree that elections are their responsibility. Cultural and language barriers impede collaboration between stakeholders with a government/legal and military background.

Although the EMB maintains contact with social media providers, it does not consider itself responsible for disinformation they disseminate. Nor does the EMB believe the security of political parties’  technology is a government responsibility.

For information influencing, including on social media, Finland maintains a cross-government counterinformation system to coordinate its response in cooperation with NGOs and the media. It also hosts the Helsinki European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. This interagency taskforce is responsible for creating public awareness of hostile information activities, training local election authorities, and informing the media and the public about the resilience aspects of elections, and serves as a network for government agencies conducting traditional and social media monitoring internationally.

For overall public communication, the prime minister’s  office issued the Central Government Communications Guidelines (Finland Prime Minister's Office 2016) that highlight the importance of interagency collaboration:

> The best buffers against information by influence are efficient cooperation between authorities, a high level of general education, good media literacy and a media committed to good journalistic practice. It is important to respond to manipulative dissemination of misleading information quickly by communicating truthful information. Special care needs to be taken to ensure that correct and reliable information published by public authorities is easy to find.

### Georgia

#### Structure of the EMB
{: .no_toc}
The Central Election Commission (CEC) of Georgia is an independent administrative body; it is free of any influence from other state bodies. The CEC is responsible for the preparation and conduct of referendums, plebiscites, presidential and parliamentary elections, and the elections of local selfgovernment representative bodies (*sakrebulo*) and local self-government executive bodies (mayor/*gamgebeli*). The CEC compiles the voter list data from the MoJ’s Public Service Development Agency.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The technology used by the CEC includes:

- an Electoral Management System;

- a results processing system to transmit data starting at the district level;

- a public website;

- a searchable voter register for personal data verification; and

- an election results interface.

Vote counting technology is currently being researched.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
In the summer of 2008, Russia waged a short but intensive war against Georgia. Alongside physical attacks, cyberattacks all over the country targeted several government agencies, ministries, media and online forums. This war was the starting point for the following initiatives:

- the establishment of the Data Exchange Agency in 2010, governed by the MoJ with core functions related to e-governance, data exchange and infrastructure and information security;

- The establishment of the Computer Emergency Response Team (cert.gov.ge, CERT) in 2011, operating under the MoJ’s Data Exchange Agency, which is responsible for identifying, registering, analysing and responding to incidents affecting government networks and critical infrastructure;

- the 2012 Law on Information Security; and

- the designation of the CEC and elections as critical infrastructure, which requires the CEC to implement its information security management system by considering ISO 27001 requirements.

Georgia has not experienced any more major cyberincidents in elections since 2008.

The CEC’s  risk management policy is based on three principles— confidentiality, integrity and availability. Most information managed by the CEC is public and therefore information integrity and availability are of the highest priority; websites and online systems face the highest risk levels. Confidential information is largely limited to the personal information provided on voter registers. Voter registers are public and available online; however, personal details can only be accessed by each citizen after presenting her or his personal ID number.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
The CEC and its Information Security and IT department are responsible for the security of election-related ICT systems. Georgia’s  Data Exchange Agency and CERT stand ready to provide emergency assistance in case of cyberincidents. The CEC also receives support and advice from CERT, including on the implementation of security measures that are required as part of the critical infrastructure designation. This includes the establishment of an information security management system.

Meetings between the CEC and CERT are conducted as needed. CERT provides recommendations and information about new developments and areas where security needs to be strengthened and advice on the procurement of new ICT systems.

The CEC also maintains a cooperation agreement with the police, who provide support if an incident occurs. In areas where the CEC lacks sufficient internal resources, including to protect against DDoS attacks, the CEC also works closely with the private sector and Internet service providers. The CEC does not maintain official contacts with social media providers, but may build such contacts in case electoral process-related disinformation is disseminated in the future.

No proactive public outreach in relation to cybersecurity is conducted prior to elections, and the CEC rarely receives questions from stakeholders. However, an incident management policy is in place that defines the roles and responsibilities in case of incidents, including clarification about when public communication and media announcements will be made.

### Latvia

#### Structure of the EMB
{: .no_toc}
Elections in Latvia are run by the Central Election Commission (CEC), which is an independent body responsible for conducting *Saeima* (parliament) elections, European Parliament elections, city council and municipality council elections, as well as national referendums. The commission deploys regional electoral commissions (119 regional polling stations) and municipal electoral commissions (1,100 local polling stations).

The *Saeima* elects the chairperson of the CEC and seven commission members. The Supreme Court, at its plenum, elects one commission member from among the judges. In practice, the chair and vice-chair of the election commission are non-partisan, while its other members are party nominees.

The State Chancellery comprises the prime minister’s  office and related departments. It prepares Cabinet meetings and coordinates planning of national policies, and has a coordinating and preventative role on cybersecurity. It organizes courses and trainings for the EMB, and state and private media. Trainings focus on preventing, crisis response and communicating with the media.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The use of ICTs in Latvian elections is limited: it has no electronic voting and no voter register. Instead, Latvians use their passports to identify themselves at polling stations. Counting takes place at decentralized locations, where ballots are scanned and projected on a big screen so that all those present can scrutinize the process. The results management system is separate from EMB servers and is only deployed during the electoral period. The EMB transmits results electronically, but uses paper backups.

Elections in Latvia are designated as critical infrastructure. In practice this affects the institutions that are involved, the standards that are applied and the mandatory levels of security, and ensures that 24/7 support is offered in the event of a crisis.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
Power or Internet outages are considered risks for which backup plans have been created. Otherwise, the State Chancellery considers unbalanced reporting to be a more significant risk than hacking of election technology.

Latvia has not had any recent cases of fake news affecting elections or direct voter suppression tactics. Rather, it has experienced indirect voter suppression from 20 years of Russian information flows, which the State Chancellery considers as presenting a more negative and less balanced view of Latvian current affairs. For instance, Russian information provides a negative view of NATO, and dedicates disproportionate attention to just two of Latvia’s political parties.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
Latvia maintains interagency collaboration in a Cybersecurity in Elections working group that includes: 

- the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT);

- the State Security Service;

- the Latvia State Radio and Television Centre, who provide telecommunications security, for instance in protecting against DDoS attacks;

- private companies that develop relevant software; and

- other actors are involved on an ad hoc basis.

These actors collaborate with the EMB but ensure that it maintains its independence. The State Chancellery also created a disinformation task force in July 2018 that has the following roles: 

- monitoring information on traditional media and social media, regarding external influencing;

- working with social media, NGOs and political parties; and

- educating the EMB.

The task force seeks to ensure that the Russian narrative does not exert undue influence on the Latvian media or citizens’  views. It counters imbalanced information by:

- developing disinformation campaign scenarios (before, during and after elections) and running simulations with media, law enforcement agencies and the CEC to help them decide what to do in case of incidents; and

- training media, law enforcement agencies and the CEC (with input from Google) on how social media work, how to check sources, how to recognize fake news, and how to recognize trolls and bots on social media.

The task force was initiated in the lead-up to the general elections on 6 October  2018. It was established by the prime minister’s  office in the State Chancellery, which allows the task force to coordinate most effectively with all related departments and security agencies. The task force convenes on an ad hoc basis and when needed.

### Mexico

#### Structure of the EMB
{: .no_toc}
The National Electoral Institute of Mexico (INE) is an autonomous, permanent entity responsible for organizing and overseeing federal elections in Mexico, and for collaborating with local EMBs to jointly conduct local elections. The supreme directive body is the General Council.

The INE’s  responsibilities and mandate have increased over time and now include electoral training and civic education at the national level, boundary delimitation and voter registration, polling station designation and appointment of poll workers, rules on preliminary results, opinion polls, quick count and electoral materials, and oversight of political parties and electoral campaign financing. The Electoral Court is a separate body responsible for electoral dispute resolution.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The INE uses state-of-the-art technologies for its internal systems, including firewalls and cloud services and 35 information systems. It contracts the monitoring of its systems to third-party providers.

Electronic voting is only allowed for Mexicans living abroad, but as of 2018 only 3,000 voters had cast their vote online. The INE is working on implementing increased online voting capabilities for future elections, but there are technical hurdles (e.g. the lack of electronic identification) as well as political obstacles to proceeding.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
DDoS and other hacking attacks have been attempted for many years. Several technologies used by the INE are online and therefore vulnerable to cyberthreats:

- website and online applications;

- polling station status monitoring system; and

- interactions that require the system to be available. 

The INE deals with direct disinformation targeted to voters on social media, but has no jurisdiction over problematic messages, such as fake news. To tackle disinformation about the status of polling stations, it has developed a mobile application that enables monitoring teams to visit polling stations on election day, verify any issues, and notify the INE (which in turn notifies social media providers) about messages that need to be taken down. Following an online incident, the INE began collaborating with social media in 1998 and is now in close collaboration with Google’s political division and has signed Memoranda of Cooperation with Facebook (El Universal 2018) and Twitter (INE 2018). 

The INE also conducts media monitoring from a financial perspective. For example, political parties are not allowed to buy airtime. Accordingly, the INE has made arrangements with Facebook and Twitter to monitor political parties’ adherence to the rules. Online campaigns with websites located outside Mexico are beyond the INE’s jurisdiction.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
Mexico’s  interagency collaboration on election security has been designed from the top down and has been in place for many years. The INE collaborates with a broad range of actors:

- universities;

- National Security Agency’s emergency response team;

- telecom operators, which freeze all system changes during election week;

- electricity providers, to minimize power interruptions; and

- government construction sector, to freeze construction work on election day to prevent disturbances.

Election technology security is overseen at three levels:

- an internal security group of 15 security experts;

- an external security group that checks systems through a private company; and 

- universities, which provide a third layer of verification to build confidence in the systems.

Mexico is debating whether to designate elections as critical infrastructure. It has a highly transparent procurement process that may be at risk of revealing sensitive information during tendering processes. There are similar concerns regarding freedom of information requests of sensitive information. Designating elections as critical infrastructure would allow restrictions of transparency in such areas.

### Moldova

#### Structure of the EMB
{: .no_toc}
Moldova’s  CEC is institutionally independent and autonomous from the executive branch of government. Lower-level EMBs under its jurisdiction are responsible for conducting elections at the sub-national level, with the exception of the Electoral Commission of the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia. Moldova has a passive automatic voter registration system. The voter lists are generated from the State Registry of Voters that is connected with the State Register of Population, which is updated daily.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The CEC carries out a number of activities using new technologies:

- Tabulation takes place in both paper and electronic form.

- A digital voter register records voters at polling stations, as an additional verification mechanism parallel to a paper voter list.

- The CEC takes its voter list data from the State Registry of Voters, which is managed by CEC representatives.

- The CEC website live streams counting in polling stations.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
The digital voter register is connected to CEC servers through the Internet. There is a risk of a cyberattack on election day, when each locality enters polling station data to the register of voters, which is subsequently transmitted to the CEC. Given the decentralized nature of the system, even a single case where the system is compromised, either through human or technical error or through an actordriven attack, would affect the credibility of other modules linked to the register, such as the voter lists and candidate lists.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
To counter such risks, the CEC formed a joint working group in 2014 with the Information Technology and Cybersecurity Service and the Security and Intelligence Service that discusses possible threats, response scenarios and the division of roles to address threats. These agencies operate under ISO 27001 information security standards, which has helped design procedures to plan and act in various scenarios. On certain issues, agencies such as the Ministry of the Interior and Internet providers are also involved.

The working group convenes only six months before an election, increasing to daily meetings in the week before an election, and has an on-site presence on election day. Since elections usually take place annually, this collaboration has become strong, a sign that interagency collaboration strengthens with more frequent elections. Ongoing discussions revolve around the management of some of the technology hardware; the CEC believes its responsibility for this clashes with its role as electoral administrator.

For some of its communication systems, the CEC relies on the security services. For instance, the Security and Intelligence Service is responsible for announcing any DDoS attacks to the public. Day-to-day cooperation between the CEC and the security agencies happens at the technical/operational level on a daily basis, with senior-level involvement in decision-making as needed.

The CEC does not work with social media providers or engage in communicating cyber-risks to the general public. Nor do the security agencies or the CEC provide support or guidance on cybersecurity at the local level, even if the CEC considers local-level access to the voter register to be a big risk.

### The Netherlands

#### Structure of the EMB
{: .no_toc}
Elections in the Netherlands are highly decentralized, which affects interagency collaboration. The roles of the EMB are divided between the Electoral Commission (*Kiesraad*), the Ministry of the Interior and individual municipalities:

- The country’s 355 municipalities are primarily responsible for organizing the vote, such as printing ballots and setting up 9,500 polling stations.

- The Electoral Commission is responsible for preparing candidate lists, aggregating votes at the national level, declaring the national result and advising the government. In the past, it has also made software available to municipalities.

- The Ministry of the Interior holds political responsibility for the implementation of the Electoral Law and creates related policies, rules and regulations. In cases of electoral disruptions, parliament can hold the minister to account.

The Ministry of the Interior fulfils three roles in the area of cybersecurity in elections—through its Directorate for Elections, the General Intelligence and Security Services, and the National Cybersecurity Centre.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
Technology in the Dutch electoral process includes the following:

- The voter register is extracted by municipalities from the Citizen Register, which is maintained and updated by the tax authorities. Voter lists for polling stations are paper based, but the personal information processed to create voter lists is part of the critical election infrastructure.

- With the abolishment of electronic voting in 2006, the most important remaining ICT system is the software OSV, which is used at the municipal level to aggregate the manually counted polling results, and to calculate election results.

- The tablet-based turnout application (StembureauApp) and ID card scanner.

- Some municipalities have recently introduced privately developed polling results applications to facilitate the tabulation of votes.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
The main risk area for the Electoral Commission is currently the OSV software. In 2017, a Dutch white hat hacker group attempted to demonstrate that OSV is not secure. Even though the commission did not agree with this analysis, the media and political impact led the minister of the interior to abruptly abolish OSV. Municipalities and the Electoral Commission objected.

Public awareness and debate over OSV since then has demonstrated that perceived cybersecurity risks can become almost as disruptive as actual cyberinterference. It also showed that old security principles and software form a major challenge in the face of new cyberthreats. Software updates alone are not enough; procedures and hardware need to be updated as well.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
As a result of public awareness and the media fallout regarding IT in elections, the multiple agencies have struggled to define their responsibilities with regard to cybersecurity in elections; the electoral law is largely silent on this issue. In early 2018, an outside agency was appointed to explore the responsibilities of all actors involved, and to map how to help each actor fulfil its responsibility, including by ensuring the necessary knowhow, resources and political backing.

In response to previous media encounters, the Electoral Commission has taken three steps. First, it has prepared ready-made responses in case perceived or real IT weaknesses occur. Second, whenever it adjusts its IT systems, it takes into account potential public criticism in the design process. Lastly, the commission involves external IT experts to advise on potential weaknesses.

### Norway

#### Structure of the EMB
{: .no_toc}
Norway’s  Ministry of Local Government and Modernization is responsible for the overall organization and conduct of national and local government elections, creating the legal framework and approving pilot schemes. It also serves as an appeal body to hear disputes involving local elections.

The Directorate of Elections provides a centralized computer system that is used for elections, guidance and training for local government authorities, and providing information to the general public. The directorate also produces and distributes election material and provides information on election results.

The election administration is decentralized to EMBs at the county and municipal levels, including 30,000 election staff working on election day who are responsible for the practical conduct of the election from approving party lists to counting the ballots. Decentralization is thought to help protect the electoral process; so far no attacks have occurred.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
Norway’s  election administration system (Elektronisk Valgadministrativt) was initially designed for the 2013 elections. It covers the entire electoral process, from candidate registration to election result processing, and includes technology for electronically marking the electoral roll as well as centralized ballot scanning. In 2011 and 2013 an Internet voting system was piloted, but then cancelled due to debates about its security.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
The security of the electronic computer system was challenged in 2017, first on social media and then in the mainstream media. Ten days before election day new regulations were issued that stipulated that all municipalities must manually count the preliminary vote. This requirement will be re-evaluated for upcoming elections.

While the election administration system is well tested and secure, the new regulations were issued to avoid any speculation or uncertainty about the election results as security and trust are vital to the conduct of elections.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
For the 2017 parliamentary election, informal cooperation with the MoJ, the Norwegian National Security Authority and the Security Police was established to: 

- monitor the electronic administrative system to detect and prevent digital operation;

- observe social media activity;

- conduct election-specific threat assessments;

- provide information to the political parties and central stakeholders; and

- offer advice and information to local election management.

This collaboration is in the process of becoming formalized.

### Romania

#### Structure of the EMB
{: .no_toc}
The Permanent Electoral Authority (PEA) is the permanent EMB of Romania. Three months before an election, temporary electoral bureaus are established, centrally and in up to 3,000 local jurisdictions, depending on the type of election. The Central Electoral Bureau consists of judges, commissioners and party representatives and oversees the election. Local election bureaus are responsible for conducting elections in up to 18,000 polling stations. The electoral bureaus’ work ends once the official results have been published.

Voter registers are based on data extracted from the civil registry, which is maintained by the Ministry of Interior; through that, citizens are registered automatically when they turn 18 years old.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The main IT system used between elections is the voter register, which is managed and updated regularly by staff from mayors’  offices throughout the country. This process provides the basis for updated electoral rolls for the election bureaus to use on election day.

The PEA provides all electoral bureaus with online tools, accessible through a private network, that support electoral tasks such as polling station management, results management, data transmission and online result presentation. Polling stations use an electronic turnout monitoring system based on ID card readers to prevent ineligible and multiple voting. The PEA also operates a results tabulation and seat allocation system, and has a web presence and online data feeds to electoral stakeholders to publish election results.

Technology has played an important role in building trust in elections. The number of complaints about the voter register, voter impersonation and multiple voting has decreased, and has stopped malpractices such as the bussing of voters.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
The main cyber-risks are related to the online voter register and other online assets of the election authority. Cyberprotection measures need to be prepared for the PEA and all electoral bureaus, and protection is based on principle of resilience of all involved bodies.

Protection mechanisms are based on scenario development and analysis and the simulation of responses to various security breaches. The ultimate main security feature and possible fallback option is the mandatory paper trail for the whole process. If an incident occurs, the paper trail contains official information that can be used to investigate any discrepancies in the ICT system.

Online systems have been exposed to many attacks such as DDoS, attempts to deface websites, scamming and structured query language injection. However, none of the attacks was very sophisticated or created significant damage.

A more serious attack vector is disinformation about PEA IT systems. In previous elections the PEA has been faced with media claims that there are shortcomings in the election IT system based on misleadingly interpreted tender documents. This had a negative impact on both the credibility of the IT systems and the PEA as a whole. These incidents showed that disinformation about the electoral process is difficult to manage once it has reached a wide audience.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
The PEA does not have a dedicated cybersecurity team. The regular ICT staff is responsible and has support from other agencies. While elections are not officially designated as critical infrastructure, most involved actors treat them as such.

For the voter register, Romania’s CERT conducts a security audit and makes related recommendations every year. After an attack, log files are provided to CERT for analysis. Additionally, a private company provides security audits every two to three months.

In non-election years security audits of the PEA are conducted in cooperation with the Special Telecommunication Service, which has military status and provides secure communication facilities to all state institutions and coordinates related activities. It is also the PEA’s  closest collaboration partner on cybersecurity. Ongoing cooperation includes security audits that are conducted whenever election technologies are modified or expanded. The Ministry of Defence provides the EMB with off-site backup server infrastructure located at military installations.

Security measures are increased in election years, which entails collaboration with CyberIT, a unit of the Romanian Intelligence Agency responsible for ensuring the cybersecurity of all state infrastructure. CyberIT also conducts nationwide, interagency scenario-based cyber exercises with a broad range of actors from academia to secret services and the election administration. There is public debate about the cooperation between intelligence services and other state actors, due to the problematic history of the intelligence services in Romania.

Following the media allegations that undermined trust in the PEA’s technology, since 2016 the commission has invited political parties to send experts to audit all election technology, including inspecting the source codes for results processing and the calculation of mandates. Party representatives are allowed to run and verify these systems on their own computers and replicate the entire results process themselves. They can also participate in an event shortly before and after each election that demonstrates that the system they verified is in fact the one used by the PEA.

Romania has not experienced large-scale foreign or other disinformation campaigns. Although technical measures have been in place for a long time, old urban myths and rumours still resonate among the population, for example about double voting and deceased voters on the list.

Cyberhygiene training programmes for political parties are being introduced to protect their internal information as well as election-related data provided by the PEA. Any hacks or data leaks from parties may therefore also create the perception of a successful attack on the PEA.

### South Africa

#### Structure of the EMB
{: .no_toc}
The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) of South Africa is a permanent body created in the country’s constitution to manage free and fair elections at the national, provincial and municipal levels of government. Although it is publicly funded and accountable to parliament, the IEC is independent from the government.

IEC provincial offices are responsible for activities in each of the nine provinces. Each provincial office has a provincial electoral officer and support staff. The provincial offices oversee 213 municipal electoral offices and 70 suboffices, and manage electoral projects, including elections.

The IEC manages the entire elections process, from planning to reporting the results. Social media are outside the IEC’s mandate.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
Voting, vote counting and local vote tallying are conducted manually. A centralized system is used for double-blind result capturing, aggregation and seat allocation as well as auditing of the results. The results are published in real time, with raw and aggregated data available for media and political parties. Scanned images of results slips are also available.

Other uses of technology are related to operational and management support:

- registration of voters, political parties, candidates, including citizen portal and online self-service tools (candidate nomination, registration status, special votes, etc.);

- the IEC’s web presence, including the online voter register; and

- administrative back-office and collaboration systems, business intelligence, issue, asset and staff tracking.

ICT security focuses on all levels, including multi-layered network segmentation, security-driven application design and development, user account management and access control on a need-to-know basis, online traffic filtering for malware, continuous security monitoring and timely information sharing about any breaches.

#### Risks

Protecting these systems against cybersecurity threats is an important part of the daily monitoring of security matters around elections and part of the IEC’s obligations and duties ‘to  develop and promote the development of electoral expertise and technology in all spheres of government’.

The IEC’s  key security considerations are openness and transparency. It emphasizes making sure that the information it shares is accurate. It detected and stopped hacking attempts in 2011 and 2014 against its website; the former was deemed severe enough to warrant a State Security Agency investigation. The IEC has not experienced a severe cybersecurity breach since then.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
The IEC has only limited reliance on other state institutions and only within their constitutional roles, including the police, security, etc. It does rely on private companies to provide specialist services. In South Africa, election security monitoring and readiness assessment occur at multiple levels:

- The IEC appoints independent commercial contractors to conduct security assessments with various levels of access to internal systems to prepare for elections.

- The Auditor General’s Office conducts security audits and is provided with all required access.

- The IEC’s IT Department and Department for Electoral Matters audit the result system for legal compliance, access control and security.

- The State Security Agency provides the IEC with a threat analysis, highlights areas that need attention (generally not including cybersecurity) and can investigate incidents as needed.

- Cooperation with the police on overall security matters is long established. However, this does not include the cyber domain.

In every election year, the IEC commissions an independent security audit of its entire ICT infrastructure, including external penetration testing through internal security controls and policy implementation, and software patch levels to identify all possible security risks and vulnerabilities. The external auditor provides an assurance report to both management and stakeholders, including remediation guidelines to technical support teams. Additionally, political parties are invited to independently audit the results system, to assure themselves that the system works as intended and prescribed in law.

Political parties asked the IEC for cybersecurity advice, which evolved into monthly Party Liaison Committee meetings (and more frequently in the run-up to elections). Small parties have very few resources and are therefore more exposed to risks and need additional support. However, parties’  cybersecurity is outside the mandate of the IEC, which can only encourage security agencies to provide more information to political actors. Overall, the IEC is planning to focus more on a broader, common understanding of emerging cyberthreats among electoral stakeholders.

### Sweden

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
The Swedish election administration is highly decentralized. The main central agency, the Swedish Elections Authority (*Valmyndigheten*), has around 20 fulltime employees and supports and guides 21 counties, each of which has one or two people working on elections. Below the county level are 291 municipalities. About eight to nine months before election day, the election workforce grows from 1–3 persons to approximately 10 staff per county and municipality for central administration. A large number of extra polling station personnel are also recruited for each election.

The Election Authority’s mandate is focused on planning and implementing the electoral process including party registration, provision of electoral materials (establishes electoral rolls, voting cards, ballots and other election material), disseminating voter information about the electoral process, and developing and maintaining election-related IT systems to process the results. Campaign oversight, election-related social media activity, voter education and calls to vote are not part of its responsibilities. Any illegal activity is the responsibility of the security agencies or the public police.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
Elections in Sweden are mostly administered manually. All key elements of the electoral process are paper based; technology is only used to increase efficiency. However, more technology is seen as unavoidable in future elections.

Digital tallying is only conducted as a parallel, redundant system. The Elections Authority utilizes a central IT system for the transmission and tabulation of results and seat allocation. This system is the main asset under its authority. An additional digital system provides the media with election results.

The tax agency supplies data on all residents for the creation of voters’ lists, and provides the Elections Authority with its website and related infrastructure. The Elections Authority currently has no significant social media presence.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
All election-related ICT systems are continuously maintained with industry-level security standards at all times; additional security is not needed for election periods. Low-level cyberattacks, such as DDoS, are expected any time, even between elections, and have no impact on the agency or its systems. Continuity plans for system breakdowns are in place and a complete fallback on manual, paper-based procedures is possible at any time.

A high emphasis is placed on data protection, as data losses and leaks are even more difficult to recover from than system breakdowns. Cyber-risks are therefore closely linked to information security, in the form of both data breaches and disinformation. Protecting systems at the municipal level is another focus area, given the limited resources available at this level.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
All Swedish authorities receive written instructions from the government every year that clearly define all of their responsibilities. While elections are not explicitly recognized as such, they have been increasingly recognized as critical national infrastructure since 2017. As a result, close collaboration on securing the electoral process between election-related agencies has been facilitated by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, which is responsible for civil protection, public safety, emergency management and civil defence as long as no other authority has responsibility. Responsibility refers to measures taken before, during and after an emergency or crisis.

Interagency cooperation is an essential part of protecting the electoral process from cyber-risks. While cooperation between the 312 local election authorities is long-standing practice, the increased need to coordinate with security agencies and other actors is a new development.

The Civil Contingencies Agency is tasked with countering any influence activities designed to disrupt, interfere with or manipulate elections. It collaborates with multiple actors including the Election Authority, intelligence services, security police, public police, local police, all election administrations at the county and local levels, the tax agency, transportation agency and the media.

The agency’s counterinfluence project consists of several stages:

- threat assessment (identify possible influence activities, assess vulnerabilities and risks, identify key actors);

- developing methods and recommendations to counter influences, increasing awareness of authorities (informing and training relevant authorities, informing the public);

- supporting cooperation between authorities (to diminish vulnerabilities);

- increasing public awareness (to diminish the effects of influence activities);

- establishing an organization to monitor, identify and counter influence activities during an election; and

- developing communication strategies and prepared narratives.

Crisis management relies on the principle of responsibility of strong autonomous authorities: ‘Whoever  is responsible for an activity in normal conditions, shall maintain that responsibility in a crisis situation.’  Those authorities are supported by the Civil Contingencies Agency through a common situational overview, information sharing and coordinated decision-making. The agency monitors the situation and publishes confirmed multi-agency information through multiple channels, including a website and various social media outlets as the primary communication channel for citizens to access all relevant information.

Coordinated information sharing is important to avoid conflicting messages, an information vacuum and an undermining of trust. Interagency cooperation therefore ensures that all agencies are always fully informed about the current situation and share the same message regarding cyberthreats.

Interagency collaboration involves regular high-level meetings between participating organizations. While in the past some agencies were reluctant to cooperate or share information, they now understand the importance of such cooperation and are very open and supportive of it. Cooperation initiated for election-related issues has also been useful in other governance areas.

Significant emphasis is placed on transparency and maintaining a wellinformed electorate and a well-prepared media. All agencies transmit a unified message that the Swedish process is decentralized, largely manual, and therefore very robust and well protected against cyberattacks. The manual process helps to mitigate concerns about cyberthreats, but has also created a need to explain why elections remain low-tech in a country where almost everything else is digital.

The overall aim is that any actual or alleged cyberincidents do not come as a surprise to the public and that the robustness of the systems is well known in advance.

### Ukraine

#### Structure of the EMB
{: .no_toc}
The Central Elections Commission (CEC) of Ukraine is a permanent, independent state body that supervises and conducts presidential, parliamentary and local self-government elections as well as referendums. The electronic voter register is updated by local state register authorities that operate independently of the CEC.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The following technologies are used for elections in Ukraine:

- the electronic State Voter Register;

- the Unified Information Analytical System ‘Elections’, an election management system supporting various stages of the electoral cycle including result transmission and tabulation systems, candidate registration, campaign finance reporting, observer registration, signature collection system for citizen initiatives and related document workflows; and

- the CEC website.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
During the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections, a series of simultaneous cyberattacks took place. The transmission of results by district electoral commissions was disrupted, malware and phishing attacks occurred, and DDoS and defacing attacks were launched against the website that displayed the election results. Similar DDoS attacks against the CEC were launched again ahead of the 2019 presidential elections.

These past attacks highlight the following key cyberthreats:

- massive attacks aimed at breaking into internal and public network resources;

- malicious software with the help of insiders or phishing techniques; and

- DDoS attacks at core election infrastructure and public websites.

While there are clear suspicions about the perpetrators, finding hard evidence is difficult and the identity of the attackers is still not known.

Major cyber-risks are related to voter lists, the publication of election results, disinformation activities aimed at undermining trust in elections, voter suppression and reducing voter turnout:

- compromising the data and systems, in order to make it difficult or impossible to implement the electoral procedures, for example creating conditions for temporary delays during elections in regions;

- unauthorized modification of voter registration data to compromise voter lists and create conditions to appeal the election results; and

- distorting information or blocking access to resources, including the results process, to discredit electoral bodies and their ability to secure the electoral process, and create opportunities to place fake messages about election results and reduce voters’ trust and turnout.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
Efforts are focused on strengthening the CEC’s technical capabilities to protect electronic registers and databases, and the information and telecommunication system they rely on, from cyberthreats and challenges. Interagency collaboration on election cybersecurity occurs primarily between the CEC and the Security Service (Ukraine’s main body responsible for cybersecurity), which dates back to 2010 and intensified after the 2014 attacks. For the 2019 elections, the Security Service was supported by the NATO–Ukraine Trust Fund on Cybersecurity to strengthen the CEC’s technical capabilities to protect it from cyberattacks.

The CEC and Security Service collaborate on a daily basis. They have formed a joint commission for the common project and work together at both the technical and senior levels. The Security Service provides both hardware and technical expertise to the CEC.

In addition, the Cyber Department of the National Police of Ukraine, State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP) and the Security Service, as well as state enterprises and private contractors, are involved in the development, certification and protection of election-related ICTs. Before they are used by the CEC, election-related information systems undergo state assessment to receive a certificate of compliance. This entails approval of the terms of references and documentation by the SSSCIP, preliminary testing, and an assessment of the system’s conformity with the terms of reference and information protection requirements. During their use, SSSCIP experts monitor the systems and protect them from attacks.

In 2018 Ukraine updated its list of critical infrastructure to specify which assets the government assumes responsibility for protecting. The CEC is responsible for all public communication on cyberprotection in elections.

### United Kingdom

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
Elections in the United Kingdom are run locally by independent returning officers based in each local authority, and in Northern Ireland by the chief electoral officer. They are overseen by an independent regulator, the UK Electoral Commission, which is responsible for party registration, regulation of political party financing, research, developing standards, and supporting elections and referendums in the UK. While the government is responsible for electoral policy and changes to the law, the commission feeds into this through reports and wider policy work.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The UK does not offer online voting. Voter registration is the responsibility of local electoral registration officers and there is no central voter register. While voting and vote counting are manual processes, several ICT applications are in place:

- a system for submitting online applications to register to vote with local authorities;

- elections management software that supports the administration of registers and elections;

- a party finance returns database including an online submission system; and

- result collation software developed for the 2016 EU Membership Referendum.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
The online voter registration system is located on the UK’s e-government website, which is maintained by the Government Digital Service as part of the Cabinet Office. This voter registration system is becoming increasingly popular among citizens. As it is available via a public website, it is potentially exposed to attacks. Safeguards and fallback options include a manual alternative of traditional registration with local electoral registration officers and additional checks based on the need to submit personal details to use the system.

The electoral management systems used by local authorities are developed by four different providers. The main risks for offline systems include ransomware, malware and the illegal publication of personal data. While there have been no reported incidents, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued guidance to local authorities, including on the organization’s  security, staff behaviour and awareness. Most data are held separately by local authorities, which limits the scope for harm by individual attacks.

The electronic result collation system, initially established for the 2016 EU Membership Referendum, has a paper-based backup that runs in parallel. Election data feeds for media and other outcome reporting channels also form a potential risk factor.

For political parties, the main risk factors are leaking of personal data of highprofile individuals and supporters, and malware and ransomware.

As little of the electoral process is digital, cyberthreats have thus far had, apart from some conspiracy theories, limited impact on voter confidence, and elections have not been designated as critical infrastructure in the UK. Yet the manual process is not risk free: mistakes can happen and the postal voting process can be problematic; there have been past allegation of tampering with mail.

An overall challenge for the Electoral Commission and the NCSC is the changing nature of cyberthreats and adversaries. Solutions need to be found to handle new threats as they emerge in a fast-changing environment. Therefore, the definition of cyber-risk differs from election to election.

Many cyber-related challenges relate to digital campaigning, micro-targeting and the implications for social media companies, parties and the government, including the need for more powers for the Electoral Commission to access information, enforce rules and sanction perpetrators.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
In the UK, the responsibility to protect elections against cyber-risks falls under the mandate of a broad range of agencies in addition to the Electoral Commission, including the NCSC, the Information Commissioner, the Constitution group in the Cabinet Office (especially in the run-up to elections), the National Crime Agency and the police.

The security of the various ICT applications as outlined above is the primary responsibility of the holder of the application, which in many cases are local administrations. The UK Electoral Commission is therefore not immediately responsible for many cyber-risks. However, in case of problems, even at the local level, attention automatically focuses on the Electoral Commission since it is the most visible election agency. While the commission cannot (and does not) protect local administrations, it can make recommendations if there is a failure in the local security system.

The Electoral Commission has collaborated with the NCSC since 2016, after reports of foreign interference in the US elections appeared. Since then, the NCSC has taken up an informal but important role in coordinating with the Electoral Commission and the Constitution group at the Cabinet Office. Given that its formal tasks are to provide both guidance and incident management support, its role with regard to elections is to compile electoral risks and to provide guidance to these bodies. The main focus of the NCSC is general elections, although it also supports local elections. Interagency meetings take place on an ad hoc basis, as required and if risks are discovered, with more frequent meetings closer to elections. At the local level, the NCSC also provides a manual on cybersecurity for returning officers and advises the association of electoral administrators.

Digital campaigning by political parties and false/misleading information on social media are of significant concern to the Electoral Commission. Although they do not fall under its immediate mandate, closely related concerns, such as voter confidence and party financing (including funding of digital campaigns) do. Hence, the commission makes legislative recommendations in this domain.

The commission’s jurisdiction is limited to UK territory. It considers foreign interference in the electoral process to be the primary responsibility of the national security agencies. Oversight related to the use of citizens’ personal data and data integrity fall in the domain of the UK Information Commissioner.

The NCSC and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure have produced briefings, guidance and information on good cybersecurity practices for the systems that support the delivery of UK elections. This includes guidance for political parties on the risks of data breaches, including phishing or spearphishing attacks, and providing evidence of recent attempts. The NCSC also regularly briefs political parties and candidates, under a strict protocol to avoid political sensitivities, to remind them of cybersecurity risks. The NCSC also engages with broadcast media on cybersecurity issues. 

High-profile cybersecurity concerns and an active interest in elections has led to good cross-government and interagency collaboration. Given the Election Commission’s  limited mandate and the fact that many different agencies have election-related responsibilities, partnerships and collaboration with other agencies are very important.

While it is generally clear what each organization does, their responsibilities are not codified in laws and procedures. The Election Commission has therefore had to develop a good understanding of the role of each organization. 

Collaboration has grown organically over time, and is largely informal. It takes place in the form of individual meetings, regular dialogue, information sharing and contingency planning between the agencies. There is close cooperation between the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner.

As all actors are rarely around one table, the UK Elections Commission plays an important role in orchestrating this information exchange. Since overprescribing may not be suitable in such a scenario, the commission can offer advice and expertise, and make sure the right messages are communicated publicly.

For public communication purposes, the Electoral Commission has established approaches on how to manage election-related incidents and how to deliver messages that enhance the trust of citizens, who expect fast and credible responses.

While the Electoral Commission does not have dedicated staff responsible for cyberthreats, a small team is available to respond to social media-related issues and regularly communicates with social media providers.

The lead for responding to incidents depends on the type of threat. A few specific election security exercises have also been held. Overall, the willingness to cooperate depends on the threat, but is limited outside election periods. The security services responsible for risk assessments need to decide where to invest their resources and will only respond if they deem the risk severe enough.

### United States of America

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
The United States has a non-uniform election administration, with more than 8,000 independently operating election jurisdictions at the local and state levels. This structure allows jurisdictions to specialize their processes to best serve the local communities. In the face of cyberthreats, multiple US federal intelligence officials identified the non-uniform nature of US elections as a security asset.

The US Electoral Assistance Commission (EAC) is an independent, bipartisan resource on election administration, established after the passage of the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The EAC serves as a clearinghouse of election administration data, tool kits and training materials. It also administers the National Voter Registration Form and the voting machine testing and certification programme. It produces the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, which is the only national voting system standard, and acts as the federal representative for election administrators in the Council of State Governments. Key tasks of the EAC are to maintain voter confidence and provide guidance to vendors.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
A diverse range of election technologies have been deployed across the USA, in part because the Help America Vote Act triggered technology investments. More than 10 years later this ageing technology created increasing vulnerabilities, the need for renewed investment in upgrades and replacement, and even calls to return to paper-backed systems that in turn would recreate previous challenges, for example related to the chain of custody and accessibility.

Election officials must now find ways to extend the life of voting technology while holding the systems to the highest standards possible and in spite of the limited funds available to build preventative measures that can withstand and recover from attacks. There is also limited funding to update systems and develop additional security expertise. Greater security measures and higher system standards cannot come at the expense of limiting accessibility for voters with disabilities, voters who need language assistance, or those serving in the military or living overseas. In 2018, USD 380 million was made available for system updates to be distributed over five years based on each state’s population.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
Due to the structure of the US election administration, the definition of cyberrisks and responsibilities is multi-faceted and depends on the actor. State and local jurisdictions are responsible for their own data and technology. Three systems are particularly important in this regard:

• voter registration systems;

• voting machines and related technologies; and

• reporting and tabulation systems.

Previous experience shows that compromising voting machines on a large scale is not necessarily the main concern. Manipulation of voter registers is a higher risk as those systems are often online and connected to the databases of various institutions. This makes protecting voter data against breaches and manipulation a key priority.

While voting technology vendors are expected to secure their technology, the need for more credible security was underscored at the 2017 and 2018 DefCon conferences, where several examples of election technologies were publicly compromised by white hat hackers. While some of the hacks happened under very unrealistic conditions, they highlighted the expectations for technology providers to respond to such claims and, where needed, adjust their systems.

An overall cyber-risk is the loss of voter confidence, even if only based on rumours. If voters assume an election’s  credibility has been compromised, they are less inclined to participate.

The First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees the freedom of speech, which exempts social media from EMB regulation or oversight. However, there are close partnerships with providers such as Google and Facebook on the development of better self-regulation. Voters must therefore be aware of their responsibilities, including to inform themselves about influence operations and the need to verify data and information. The EAC provides information videos online to inform voters of their responsibility to uphold electoral integrity (EAC 2018).

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
The EAC is a partnership-driven agency that collaborates with diverse institutions, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Department of Defense, the US Postal Service, the National Association of State Election Directors, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Security Agency and public policy research institutions. It also cooperates with the private sector and election technology providers.

Collaboration between the EAC and the DHS started before the 2016 election and helped the DHS communicate security information to election officials and administrators, and to understand elections and election administrators’ feedback. In 2017 the DHS designated elections as critical infrastructure. This designation shapes how the federal government views and interacts with a sector and prioritizes the allocation of security resources. For example, it allowed the involvement of the DHS and its massive security capacity, including 240,000 staff, to provide support to election administrators in areas from risk identification to the provision of cybersecurity advice.

Local election officials initially had reservations about cooperating with federal officials, particularly from the DHS. The EAC, which represents all election administrators, played an important role in legitimizing DHS cooperation. Another challenge has been the timely and useful transfer of information between election officials. The Multi-State Information Sharing Analysis Center has created an information-sharing pilot programme that will allow owners and operators of election technology to better secure their systems against cyberthreats (Hicks 2018).

Coordinated interagency collaboration is organized in two mayoral forums. The EAC is represented in both and was instrumental in setting them up:

- The Elections Government Sector Coordination Council brings local, state and federal EMBs together every two months to exchange information and plan for cyber-resilience with DHS support. This cooperation is largely formalized and official protocols for disseminating information have been established.

- The Sector Coordinating Council brings together a broad range of private actors, from technology vendors to media representatives. The council is self-organized and meets about twice a month in a joint call.

A challenge in cooperation with the private sector is that in the wake of cybersecurity concerns, many small companies emerged that need to be legitimized, which created a new role for both the DHS and EAC.

The US electoral process relies on a large number of polling officials who are not always aware of how to keep technology secure. The EAC therefore offers training to ensure election officials are able to respond to cyberattacks. In cooperation with the Belfer Center training exercises were created that condense six months of work around elections into scenarios that can be practised in three hours.
