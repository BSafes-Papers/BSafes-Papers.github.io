## Annex A: Case studies
A series of case study interviews with EMBs and security agencies from around the world were conducted for this publication. Some of these interviews are reflected in the following country case studies. Other interviews were used to provide additional background information and details. The interviews were structured by the following themes:

- overview of institution and use of ICTs; 

- definition of cyber-risks in elections; 

- overview of cyber-risks for election-related systems and processes; 

- actors involved in protecting elections against cyberattacks; and 

- coordinated cooperation between the relevant actors.

### Australia

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is responsible for conducting federal elections and referendums and maintaining the Australian Commonwealth electoral roll. Australia has 151 electoral divisions, each of which is represented by a member of the House of Representatives. Divisional offices manage the electoral roll, carry out public awareness activities and administer elections.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The AEC has a history of effectively implementing legislative change that requires the use of technology, while maintaining the integrity of the electoral system. It trialled electronic voting for certain groups, including blind and low-vision voters, in the 2007 federal election. This evolved into the current method of telephone voting for these groups.

Currently, the AEC uses various IT systems, ranging from legacy, 20-year-old mainframes to modern cloud-based services. It is responsible for:

- a highly scalable website (from 20 hits between elections to 20 million on election day); 

- ballot scanners operated by third-party providers at a counting centre in each state to count the complex preferential ballots; 

- a data transmission and tabulation system; 

- a voter registration system (hosted by a third-party provider) used to create voter rolls and share voter data with political parties; and

- electronic certified lists in selected locations to find and mark voters off the electoral roll.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
A priority for the AEC is to protect its IT systems—particularly those related to counting votes and transmitting data—and the overall electoral process from integrity challenges. Manual procedures, including a paper count, are always possible and available as a backup plan for a worst-case scenario.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
The Australian Government places a high priority on its cybersecurity policy. It provides standard policies and a security manual for protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of government data and IT systems in its Protective Security Policy Framework (Australian Government AttorneyGeneral’s Department n.d.).

This high standard is not specific to elections; it covers information security in digital and hard copy format as well as physical and personal security. Applying this standard, the AEC treats cyber-risks in the same way as other government entities. Therefore it has a dedicated IT security advisor as part of its Information Security and Governance unit.

Following increasing global concerns, Australia established an Electoral Integrity Task Force in May 2018 to shore up its processes for upcoming byelections and to inform future federal elections. The task force brings together a range of agencies—the AEC, state and territorial EMBs, the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Cybersecurity Centre, the Department of Communications and security agencies. It has assessed vulnerabilities related to elections and electoral processes. The task force seeks to:

- develop a shared understanding of vulnerabilities and how they evolve between elections; 

- conduct risk assessments and make related suggestions; 

- clarify the role, coordination and leadership between participating agencies; 

- advise the AEC and state and territorial EMBs on risk mitigation; 

- coordinate the monitoring of social media; and 

- develop a joint communications strategy.

Additionally, the Council of Australian Governments has asked that cyberrelated ‘health’ checks are conducted on all Australian electoral commissions. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of the Australian Parliament raised the classification of Australia’s  electoral systems as national critical infrastructure as an important matter for inquiry (Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia 2019).

The AEC also maintains ongoing communications with social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google to inform management of electoral messaging.

### Austria

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
In Austria, elections are managed in a mixed system: an independent Federal Electoral Board (Commission) works with the Federal Ministry of Interior. The different levels of election administration include the federal electoral board, provincial electoral boards, district electoral boards, municipality electoral boards and a special electoral board. Local administrations are responsible for all election operations.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
The voting process is paper based with manual counts and paper reports. As soon as the polling station is closed the preliminary reports are transmitted via phone, email or text message. These preliminary data are stored on a Ministry of Interior server. These data are not legally binding, but need to be protected from disclosure before voting ends at the last polling station. The digital result figures are compared with provincial reports and the preliminary final results are published on the Internet and announced by the minister. All software is constantly improved and modernized, and the system is tested before every election.

A new centralized electronic voter register was launched in 2018. It facilitates improved data quality and online participation and signing of public initiatives. Municipalities are still responsible for maintaining the local voter registers, but all data are stored on a centralized platform. The added convenience of online participation led to increased interest and unprecedented demand for signing public initiatives.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
The electronic transmission of results consists of ad hoc reports that are not legally binding. The Constitutional Court ruled that only paper minutes are legally relevant for determining the final result. However, even problems with preliminary results may raise doubts: the results publication website led to some discussion when glitches made test data publicly available before election day.

A few days after its launch, the online public initiative system became inaccessible for many users. While the problem was fixed quickly, it triggered a parliamentary inquiry, which established that there were no external (cyber) threats of attacks. It was rather the unexpectedly high interest and load on this new online system that led to very slow response times, but never a full collapse of the system.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
Interagency collaboration takes place via Austria’s  national election network, which was constituted in November 2018. The network covers agencies with mandates related to elections (through the Ministry of Interior, Federal Electoral Board and Foreign Ministry); cybersecurity and network security (through the Federal Chancellery and Ministry of Interior); cyber defence (through the Ministry of Defence); media law, election campaigning and political parties (through the Federal Chancellery); registers and cybercrime (through the Ministry of Interior); online services and digital issues (through the Ministry for Digital Matters); data protection and criminal law (through the Ministry for Constitution, Reform and Justice); and European law and institutional issues (through the Foreign Ministry). The Ministry of Interior serves as the network’s national point of contact for the EU.

### Bulgaria

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
Elections in Bulgaria are administered by a three-level structure of EMBs: the Central Election Commission (CEC), 31 district election commissions and approximately 12,000 precinct election commissions.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
Voter lists are extracted from the national population register maintained by the Civil Registration and Administration Services Department of the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works.

The CEC creates and maintains websites and various registers, and maintains the email system used by the various levels of election administration as well as a system for submitting electronic applications for out-of-country voting. It also enables electronic data exchange for voters and candidates between Bulgaria and other EU member states. It further operates an electronic system for approving pre-printed samples of paper ballots, for electronic results processing and transmission for out-of-country voting.

The election law provides for paper and machine voting. During the 2016 presidential election, machine voting was conducted for the first time at 500 polling stations and the results were official. An experimental machine vote count was also conducted. A pilot of remote electronic (Internet) voting was initiated on 1 January 2018 under the responsibility of the CEC. Preliminary voter lists are required to be posted for public scrutiny at polling stations and on municipality websites at least 40 days  before an election. Lastly, the National Audit Office makes campaign-related bank transactions publicly available on its website.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
Following an inventory check of election-related ICT, the CEC adopted a cyberrisk management methodology to identify the possible impact of the risk on the election process, the probability of such risks and remediation measures. This information is updated immediately before an election. The main technical risks covered in the methodology include:

- DDoS—in 2013 and 2015 the commission’s public infrastructure was attacked on an unprecedented scale; 

- leaks of voters’/candidates’ personal data (potential threat); 

- insufficient competence of election commissions at various levels; 

- change of data and content by users with administrative access, by mistake or deliberate; 

- fake news (potential threat); and 

- information security breach of publicly available resources through attacks involving content change/substitution, including hacking individual machines, attacks leading to equipment malfunctioning, and manipulation of data during transfer and result processing as potential threats, especially after the introduction of remote e-voting and machine voting.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
To protect the election process, the CEC collaborates with a wide range of partners in public administration and technology companies. Bulgaria’s  egovernment and information security operations are contracted to the State eGovernment Agency and resources of the Ministry of Interior, the State Agency for National Security and other bodies.

The main technological partner of the CEC is the state-owned company Information Services JSC. JSC experts are in charge of the CEC’s  critical infrastructure and the development and implementation of computer processing of the results and online attendance when elections are held.

The CEC is responsible for coordinating between all relevant actors, including during an incident. At the national level, an interservice group is chaired by the deputy prime minister, which coordinates and plans the activities before, during and after election day.

Before each election, the public prosecutor general and the minister of interior set up joint headquarters (teams) for operational interaction in the fight against election-related (including cyber) crimes. These teams are operational during the entire pre-election campaign and on election day.

The CEC and its technological partner are continuously improving the cyberprotection methods and technologies. ICT centres for processing election results data are physically independent environments, which prevents external interference during processing operations. The public systems are backed up several times: they are equipped with modern cyberprotection systems and monitored 24/7 by information security experts. The organization’s measures for preventing cyberattacks cover the parties directly participating in an election and other relevant parties such as national Internet providers and telecommunication operators, transmission system operators, etc.

A large-scale public information campaign is organized during in the run-up to elections. Regular briefings are conducted, and close cooperation is established with the media in effort to prevent fake news campaigns.

### Canada

#### Structure of EMB
{: .no_toc}
Headed by the chief electoral officer of Canada, Elections Canada is an independent, non-partisan parliamentary agency responsible for administering the Canada Elections Act. The agency’s mandate is to:

- be prepared at all times to conduct a federal general election, by-election or referendum; 

- administer the political financing provisions of the Canada Elections Act; 

- monitor compliance with electoral legislation; 

- conduct public information campaigns on voter registration, voting and becoming a candidate; 

- conduct education programmes for students on the electoral process; 

- provide support to the independent commissions in charge of adjusting the boundaries of federal electoral districts following each decennial census; 

- carry out studies on alternative voting methods and, with the approval of parliamentarians, test alternative voting processes for future use during electoral events; and 

- provide assistance and cooperation in electoral matters to electoral agencies in other countries or to international organizations.

#### Use of ICTs
{: .no_toc}
For federal elections, Canada relies on paper ballots that are hand marked by voters and hand counted by officials in some 25,000 different polling stations across the country. This process is observed by scrutineers from each of the major political parties. The election administration is highly decentralized and paper based so documents can be verified after each election. Electronic voting systems are also used. Elections Canada uses new technology to:

- manage electronic networks and intranets at headquarters and in the field to enable communications; 

- maintain and improve applications supporting the National Register of Electors and the Electoral Geography Database, as well as several other tools that support real-time monitoring of (and reporting on) electoral events; 

- develop and expand the agency’s social media presence; 

- create customized applications that support key services, such as the Voter Information Service, real-time broadcasting of election results and online reporting for political entities; 

- develop and support customized applications that enable political parties, electoral district associations, candidates, nomination contestants and leadership contestants to complete and submit the financial returns required by the Canada Elections Act; and 

- maintain an Online Voter Registration Service, launched in 2012, which offers an alternative way for citizens to check and update their registration status.

#### Risks
{: .no_toc}
At the federal level, errors in result transmission or attacks against result publication websites may happen, but the results are always verifiable through the paper trail and not even the most sophisticated cyberattack could tamper with them. Local elections are more exposed to cyberthreats, since more technology such as ballot scanners, tabulators and online voting systems is used.

Canada is not immune to attacks designed to suppress the number of people who vote or manipulate how they vote. So far, the only documented attack was the 2011 Robocall scandal, in which thousands of voters in almost 250 ridings across the country reported receiving automated phone messages falsely telling them that their polling station had been changed. Elections Canada’s investigations attributed these calls to domestic political actors.

The Canadian Government has tasked the Canadian Communications Security Establishment (CSE) with assessing the cyberthreats to the country’s democratic process (CSE 2017) and advising parties on best practices to protect themselves from cyberthreats and to safeguard their databases of personal voter information.

The CSE details three key cyberthreats:

- registering voters: attacks against systems determining who is eligible to vote; 

- voting: attacks against systems for receiving, counting and recording the votes; and

- disseminating results: attacks against systems for informing the public of the election results.

The CSE assessment pointed to mostly unsophisticated and low-level attacks in past elections, and highlighted political parties, individual politicians and the media as being the most vulnerable. It expects more (and more sophisticated) attacks in future elections. The assessment concluded that multiple groups will very likely deploy cyber-related capabilities in an attempt to influence the democratic process during the 2019 federal election. This prompted Elections Canada to enhance its cybersecurity posture by improving the security design of its IT network and procuring a new data-hosting service that will offer a range of additional protections, all in consultation with the CSE.

#### Interagency collaboration
{: .no_toc}
The minister of democratic institutions is responsible for leading the government’s efforts to defend the democratic process from cyberthreats, together with the CSE, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and Public Safety Canada, among others.

In June 2018, the Government of Canada announced the creation of the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity, which aims to offer a unified approach to cybersecurity and enable faster, better-coordinated and more focused government responses to cyberthreats (which may or may not be election related). Elections Canada works with these security partners to stay up to date on the threat environment. Additionally, the Election Integrity Office, which was established following the 2011 Robocall incident, assesses domestic and international cyberthreats, and aims to prevent them.

Elections Canada coordinates with other government organizations that have mandates related to election security: the commissioner of Canada Elections, the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Public Safety Canada and Canada’s national security advisor.

The delivery of trusted/secure elections is a joint undertaking involving Elections Canada, security agencies, political participants, the media, private industry and civil society. The efforts span four complementary layers of assurance and collaboration:

- 1.National security and emergency management, which entails defending Canada against a range of security threats/events including foreign interference and intrusion. The key initiatives are:

  - briefings to political parties and federal/provincial elections officials on threats to electoral processes in Canada;

  - meetings with foreign security and intelligence partners to discuss their efforts and experience;

  - establishing relationships with social media companies;

  - intelligence assessments including the CSE’s 2017 report, *Cyberthreats to Canada’s Democratic Process;* and 
  
  - various planning and simulation exercises.

- 2.Democratic institutions, which involves building the resilience of the country’s democratic institutions in the context of emerging threats to ensure whole-of-government coordinated action. The key initiative is the passage of the Elections Modernization Act (Bill C-76) in 2018. The bill includes measures that aim to make the electoral process more secure, including by:

  - strengthening the third-parties’ regime;

  - adding prohibitions related to the use of foreign funds;

  - giving additional powers to the commissioner of Canada Elections;

  - expanding existing provisions against certain types of online impersonation and false statements; and

  - requiring social media platforms to publish and preserve archives of election and partisan ads.

- 3.Electoral security, which entails joint efforts to ensure the security of the electoral process. EMB independence is positioned within joint activities and key initiatives:

  - Joint Steering Committee (EMB and lead security agencies)— meets monthly;
  
  - mandates clarified
  
  - interagency collaboration/mutual support instituted;

  - protection of electoral infrastructure strengthened; and

  - outreach to political parties/social media ongoing

 Planned initiatives:

  - finalization/testing of Incident Management Plan;

  - conduct of various planning and training exercises;

  - finalization of communications strategy; and

  - reinforcement of trusted sources of information.

- 4.EMB security, which consists of joint work with security partners to strengthen EMB infrastructure and security posture. Key initiatives include:

  - Electoral Integrity and Disinformation team in place; 

  - enhanced systems’ security and systems’ monitoring; 

  - launch of security awareness, including field operations; 

  - security governance and plan improved; 

  - collection/sharing EMB best practices; meetings with political parties; and

  - engaged social media platforms and establishing communication channels to quickly respond to incidents.

  Planned initiatives:

  - continue to establish Elections Canada as a trusted source of information on when, where and how to register and vote; 

  - planning/training exercises completed, including election simulation; and

  - social media monitoring.

  The overall target is to:

  - keep voting simple and convenient and to make basic cyberhygiene accessible to all;

  - sustain discussion with political parties and civil society to recognize the political economy of cybersecurity, avoid politicizing electoral security, and manage public and political expectations; and 
  - facilitate communications through a trusted voice and public spokespersons, dealing with the changing media environment and ensuring coherent and seamless support to citizens.

In early 2019 the Government of Canada unveiled its plan to fight disinformation and foreign interference in a multi-pronged approach that involves the Ministry of Democracy Institutions, Defence and Public Safety, and Emergency Preparedness and builds on four pillars: (a) enhancing  citizen preparedness by providing information to the public; (b) improving organizational readiness through improved coordination; (c) combatting foreign interference through security agencies; and (d) expecting social media platforms to help safeguard elections.

Under the Critical Election Incident Protocol, five senior public servants decide when an incident is serious enough to warrant informing the public during the official campaign period. Their decision will be based on information provided by the national security agencies.
