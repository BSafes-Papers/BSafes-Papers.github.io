## Abstract
The purpose of this thesis is to examine the growing national security threat posed by Russia and China’s willingness to exercise 21st century information warfare techniques against the United States and its areas of strategic interest. This study will describe the composition of these state’s foreign disinformation entities while providing several case studies that display their advanced capabilities and the direct effects that each poses on the general public both domestically and internationally. To best provide unbiased reporting and accuracy in each country’s analysis, this study will rely on the diversified use of government reports, legal documents, academic journals, and news articles. After research into each state, this study will conclude with several recommendations for President-elect Joe Biden and his administration. Ultimately this study will advance the belief that as the United States changes administration, it remains imperative that the federal government acknowledges the growing threat of international adversaries that actively target our democracy and act proactively in defensive and offensive measures.

## Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the unwavering support offered by Professor Hilary Appel. Without having the opportunity to take a course with Professor Appel, I would have never discovered my passion for international relations. Even though I was fairly quiet during class discussion, I want you to know that it was simply an attempt to allow for me to take in your vast wealth of knowledge and expertise. You have taken the time to voluntarily foster my intellectual curiosity with opportunities outside of the traditional classroom setting and for that I am grateful. Thank you for your help and I hope to remain in contact with you for years to come.

Additionally, I would like to acknowledge my parents, Jeff and Melissa, for providing me with the opportunity to find my calling and pursue it without hesitation. It has been an inspiration to watch and learn from you both throughout my twenty-two years of life, thus far. There has not been a day that passes by over the past four years, where I fail to reflect on the opportunities that I have been afforded due to your commitment to providing for me. From early mornings on the track, to caring for me after a military training exercise, to daily facetime check-ins… thank you for always being there and pushing me to go one step further.

Lastly, I would like to thank my friends, my fellow soldiers, and the faculty of Claremont McKenna College. Without the empowerment that I received from each and everyone of you, I truly would not be the person that I am today. Your stories, your wisdom, and your selflessness has empowered me to overcome the imposter syndrome that had once consumed me as a first generation college and transfer student. I entered into this four year journey as an insecure follower and I will proudly leave as a confident leader.

Cheers to the lasting prosperity of our great nation and the generations of brave and selfless men and women that have dedicated their lives to service on behalf of the American people. May God bless our democracy and may God bless the United States of America.
