## IV. National Security Challenges to the U.S. Unilateral Economic Sanctions

Broad sanctions that gives extensive discretion to the President to implement may result in criminal convictions, as permitted under TWEA and IEEPA, have been challenged in courts on constitutional grounds—however, such cases rarely succeed.<sup>112</sup> As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in *Regan v. Wald*, these are matters “so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference.”<sup>113</sup> IEEPA’s immunity from constitutional attack is striking because of its especial open-ended terms.<sup>114</sup>The Act provides a broad authority to the President to implement sanctions without going to Congress.<sup>115</sup> Challenges to IEEPA on First Amendment and other constitutional grounds has not been successful, although courts agreed that the Act provides “sweeping and unqualified” grants of power to the President.<sup>116</sup> The courts have denied claims that IEEPA provides an unconstitutional grant of “essentially unbridled discretion to the Executive Branch”63 or that it is “unconstitutionally vague.”<sup>117</sup> The same judicial argument applies to the other laws authoring sanctions that are challenged on different constitutional grounds.<sup>118</sup> Since the probability of success of any such claims is low, the risks of non-compliance with sanctions are surprising high. The scope and applicability of the rules can be difficult to assess, and recent cases demonstrate the magnitude of the U.S. government’s reaction to violations.<sup>119</sup> 

As mentioned above, economic sanctions can be aimed against nationstates or specific individuals and entities, and may include measures such as asset freezes, import tariffs, trade barriers, travel bans, and embargoes.<sup>120</sup>

OFAC has overseen many longstanding and recent financial sanctions as weapons in modern warfare against American enemies as diverse as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, terrorist organizations, Mexican drug cartels, and foreign nation-states. <sup>121</sup> For instance, the U.S. and its allies imposed a series of economic sanctions against Russia and certain Russian citizens following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.<sup>122</sup>
