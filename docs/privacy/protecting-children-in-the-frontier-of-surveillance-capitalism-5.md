## V. CONCLUSION
[50] These times are certainly a-changin’. Privacy concerns are at the forefront of the internet’s proliferation. Behemoths like Facebook and Google are leading the way into the digital frontier, and FTC penalties are metaphorical drops in the bucket on their path to malapert achievements. Privacy is no longer a give-and-take scenario: companies freely take all we have and leave us with apps to update and newsfeeds to scroll. Future research will soon point to the irrelevancy of this paper’s diminished understanding of the internet today. This latency only shows the speed at which the internet transforms our world. Nevertheless, these issues must be discussed for the conversation to continue.

[51] Come Senators, Congresspeople, please heed the call. A child’s life has value and deserves protection. Children are already functioning as consumers and will soon enter the “real world” knowing no other lives aside from their screens. Leaders are made for the occasion as much as the occasion is made for leaders. Children must be protected as society begins surveying the frontier of surveillance capitalism.
