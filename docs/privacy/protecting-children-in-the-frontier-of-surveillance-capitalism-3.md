## III. CONTEXTUALIZING THE PROBLEM OF PRIVACY
[16] The right to privacy transforms with each generation. George Orwell’s 1984 is often cited when discussing the intersection of technology and privacy rights.<sup>72</sup> The error is thinking that Orwell’s imagination is still a way’s away— in the future, close but not quite here, or otherwise confined to its pages written decades ago. Of course, the reality is that “Big Brother” is actually Big Tech and 1984’s plot is yesterday’s news. While older generations gradually discover their online activity is under constant surveillance, younger generation’s right to online protection is vaporizing.

***
<sup>72</sup> *See generally* GEORGE ORWELL, 1984 (1949) (“We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship.”).

### A. Surveillance Capitalism Defined

[17] In her seminal work, The *Age of Surveillance Capitalism*, Professor Shoshana Zuboff defines “surveillance capitalism” as “the new logic of accumulation.”<sup>73</sup> Professor Zuboff elaborates:

> Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Although some of these data are applied to product or service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary *behavioral surplus,* fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as ‘machine intelligence,’ and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now, soon, and later. Finally, these *prediction products* are traded in a new kind of marketplace for behavioral predictions that I call *behavioral futures markets.* Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations, for many companies are eager to lay bets on our future behavior.<sup>74</sup>

[18] Professor Zuboff provides a framework for understanding the novelty of surveillance capitalism: (1) the logic, (2) the means of production, (3) the products, and (4) the marketplace.<sup>75</sup> Google is considered the “pioneer” of surveillance capitalism and their business practice can be traced through the proliferation of its online advertising business model.<sup>76</sup>

#### 1. The Logic
[19] Google’s discovery of “behavioral surplus” allowed the company to “translate its nonmarket interactions” into “prediction products” readily available for advertisers.<sup>77</sup> Prediction products are “surveillance assets” which ultimately produce “surveillance revenues” and “surveillance capital.”<sup>78</sup> The adage “[i]f a service is free, you’re the product,”<sup>79</sup> is no longer true. “Instead, we are the *objects* from which raw materials are extracted and expropriated for Google’s prediction factories. Predictions about our behavior are Google’s products . . . . *We are the means to others’ ends.”*<sup>80</sup> Whereas industrial capitalism expropriates nature’s raw material (e.g., wood, stone, crude oil, etc.) and cuts, cleaves, and compounds commodities (e.g., lumber, countertops, plastics, etc.), surveillance capitalism captures human nature (e.g., patterns, behaviors, inclinations, etc.) and contrives “prediction products.”<sup>81</sup>

#### 2. The Means of Production
[20] Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the new means of production.<sup>82</sup> As Google (and other surveillance capitalists) accumulate more data, their “machine intelligence” evolves and their prediction products become more accurate.<sup>83</sup> Indeed, Google researchers have already introduced a new “deep-neural network model” to significantly improve “clickthrough rate”<sup>84</sup> predictions.<sup>85</sup>

#### 3. The Products
[21] Viable “prediction products” forecast our thoughts, feelings, and likely actions based on data that are processed by machine intelligence.<sup>86</sup> These products are heavily guarded from competitors and the general public.<sup>87</sup> The goal is pseudo-certainty: as prediction products become more certain, the more online commerce will commence.<sup>88</sup>

#### 4. The Marketplace
[22] Though the market was initially limited to advertisers, “behavioral futures markets” are now open to any entity—advertiser, businessperson, politician, or otherwise<sup>89</sup>—keenly interested in influencing future behavior.<sup>90</sup> In the same way that mass production was not confined to automobile manufacturers, surveillance capitalism with its new logic, means, and products will not be bridled to online advertising.<sup>91</sup>

### B. A Whole New Problem
[23] Congress’ twentieth-century understanding of the internet is no longer applicable to today’s digital milieu.<sup>92</sup> Children have shifted from“familiar fill-in-the-blank questionnaires”<sup>93</sup> and “customize[d] MySpace pages”<sup>94</sup> to today’s trendy and entrenched social media sites. This transition represents much more than “stranger danger”;<sup>95</sup> it represents a vast, unsettled frontier. A child’s every movement across the internet— from a Santa-gifted iPad to a school-issued Chromebook—is often hunted, captured, prodded, and aggregated before being shipped off to the highest bidder. Welcome to the frontier of surveillance capitalism.

#### 1. Mental and Social Development
[24] Teens are sharing more information on social media sites than they ever have before.<sup>96</sup> In turn, their mental health severely suffers.<sup>97</sup> Researchers have shown that Generation Z—“the first group of digital natives, with no memory of life before the rise of surveillance capitalism”— relies on four to five social media platforms for “psychological sustenance.”<sup>98</sup> Researchers reported findings of “loneliness and acute disorientation that overwhelm young people when faced with disconnection from social media.”<sup>99</sup> Given the fact that 95% of Generation Z uses smartphones and 45% are online “on a near-constant basis,” it makes sense that teenagers today increasingly see themselves through their social media accounts, or what researchers call an “outside-looking-in approach.”<sup>100</sup> This phenomenon further entrenches the feelings of “disorientation and isolation” and “suggests a psychological dependency on the ‘others.’”<sup>101</sup>

[25] Today’s children are different from children two to three generations ago.<sup>102</sup> Psychologists denote “emerging adulthood” as the years between eighteen and the late twenties, and the essential challenge for this new “life stage” is differentiating self from others.<sup>103</sup> The separation between childhood and adulthood is growing in today’s time: “emerging adulthood is to the twenty-first century what adolescence was to the twentieth.”<sup>104</sup>

[26] Psychologists have said that the essential challenge of “emerging adulthood” is delineating between one’s self and social peers.<sup>105</sup> The proliferation of social media muddles this delineation.<sup>106</sup> Professor Zuboff expatiates three ways the “enduring existential task of self-making”<sup>107</sup> is morphed by the internet’s prevalence: (1) accelerated individualization, (2) online socialization, and (3) the domination of “network publics.”<sup>108</sup> Professor Zuboff expounds further:

<sup>102</sup> *Id.* at 462 (explaining that “[s]ocial media marks a new era in the intensity, density, and pervasiveness of social comparison processes, especially for the youngest among us, who are ‘almost constantly online’ at a time of life when one’s own identity, voice, and moral agency are a work in progress. In fact, the psychological tsunami of social comparison triggered by the social media experience is considered unprecedented. If television created more life dissatisfaction, what happens in the infinite spaces of social media?”).

> Young life now unfolds in the spaces of private capital, owned and operated by surveillance capitalists, mediated by their ‘economic orientation,’ and operationalized in practices designed to maximize surveillance revenues. These private spaces are the media through which every form of social influence—social pressure, social comparison,<sup>109</sup> modeling, subliminal priming—is summoned to tune, herd, and manipulate behavior in the name of surveillance revenues. This is where adulthood is now expected to emerge.<sup>110</sup>

[27] Facebook has openly acknowledged that their platform is a “sensory experience of communication that helps us connect to others, without having to look away.”<sup>111</sup> Their platform is based on the addictive nature of casino games with the intention that users enter a mental state called the “machine zone”: a connection between user and device that invokes a “loss of self-awareness, automatic behavior, and a total rhythmic absorption carried along on a wave of compulsion.”<sup>112</sup> Anyone who has scrolled their Facebook feed for an extended period of time and suddenly “snaps out of it” knows the feeling.<sup>113</sup>

#### 2. Data Collection
[28] Internet users are generally unaware of how tech companies use aggregated data collection. For instance, the *Journal of Social Studies Research* published a study that examined high school students’ responses to the discussion of internet privacy.<sup>114</sup> Three startling themes emerged from the researchers’ analysis of the students’ responses:

- (1) students displayed a surprising trust in Facebook and Google; 

- (2) students framed the issue of Internet Privacy as a conflict in values and a set of trade-offs; and 

- (3) students tended to put more weight on personal consequences and responsibility than on implications for democracy in their assessment of the (acknowledged) erosion of privacy as a result of social media and Internet search engines.<sup>115</sup>

[29] Teenagers implicitly trust tech companies and presume that the companies are acting in the user’s best interest.<sup>116</sup> Researchers speculated that such lackadaisical responses could stem from broader themes of tradeoffs around privacy in the post-9/11 world.<sup>117</sup> Americans generally accepted the increase in state surveillance as a tradeoff for increased protection.<sup>118</sup> Thus, the “cultural zeitgeist” in which these students grew up fundamentally shaped their conceptions of online privacy: “[p]erhaps the traditional valuation of privacy by adolescents needs redefinition in a media-saturated society in which young people live their lives on [social media], without much thought about the potential long-term consequences for their adulthood.”<sup>119</sup>As another study explains:

> When asked whether [students] thought Facebook gives anyone else access to the information they share, one middle schooler wrote: ‘Anyone who isn’t friends with me cannot see anything about my profile except my name and gender. I don’t believe that [Facebook] would do anything with my info.’ Other high schoolers shared similar sentiments, believing that Facebook would not or should not share their information.<sup>120</sup>

[30] When similarly question, however, parents expressed deep concern over how much information companies could learn about their children simply by tracking their children’s online behavior.<sup>121</sup>

#### 3. Sexual exploitation
[31] As an empirical matter, children’s online presence increases their exposure to sexual content and solicitation.<sup>122</sup> Even before the rise of social media, experts warned of the proliferation of child exploitation and pornography as the internet pullulated from its nascency.<sup>123</sup> Sexual predators frequently use social media sites as a way to lure children into sexual conversations.<sup>124</sup> Despite this knowledge, internet service providers and social networking sites are likely legally inculpable.<sup>125</sup> Predators may target young people that respond well to online attention, particularly those that are “insecure, needy, [and] isolated.”<sup>126</sup> Children are apt to disclose personal information, either intentionally or unintentionally, thereby making a sexual predator’s “grooming” that much easier.<sup>127</sup>
