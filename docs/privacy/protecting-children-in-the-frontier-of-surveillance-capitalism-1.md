## I. INTRODUCTION
[1] This article examines the ongoing technological revolution and its impact on today’s consumers. In particular, this article addresses the promulgation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the context of “surveillance capitalism”<sup>2</sup> and analyzes the harms associated with social media and data collection. Finally, this paper will argue that COPPA should be revamped to better regulate the Internet of 2020. A just society ought to protect children from the lurking perils of social media.

[2] Modernity has precipitously arrived. Gone are the days of logging into or dialing up the internet. Modernity stomped over and trampled upon the internet of yesteryear, leaving society to look around and ask “What happened?” Consider Rachael Malkin’s opening paragraph regarding children’s “Internet” usage in 2002:

> Everyday after school, millions of children come home and immediately log onto the Internet. They happily click onto the websites of all their favorite TV shows and musical groups. As they surf these sites, the familiar fill-in-the-blank questionnaires pop up on the screen and request their names, ages, genders, addresses and phone numbers. Children plug in the necessary information and continue to click away.<sup>3</sup>

[3] This once-relevant documentation of children’s internet usage is now antiquated—a relic of days long gone, never to return. Today, more personal data is collected from an individual’s smart phone than any “familiar fill-in-the-blank questionnaire” could reasonably solicit.<sup>4</sup> Though children today interact over the internet in vastly different ways than two decades ago, the privacy protections afforded to these children remain unchanged.<sup>5</sup>

They also have the ability to post messages directly onto their friends' MySpace pages. They can post their own daily blogs—expressing their thoughts and ideas about the trivial and the philosophical alike.”) (footnotes omitted).

[4] Society sits at an unprecedented juncture of data collection and privacy rights.<sup>6</sup> Millennials will be the last generation to recall a time before the internet’s proliferation.<sup>7</sup> A wider audience is beginning to understand that personal data is constantly collected, “anonymized,”<sup>8</sup> and controlled by companies. Although collected data can benefit the user,<sup>9</sup> companies can also use this data to shape buying habits<sup>10</sup> and manipulate political philosophies.<sup>11</sup> Criminals have begrimed the internet, targeting susceptible populations online<sup>12</sup> and spreading false information about the Covid-19 pandemic.<sup>13</sup>

[5] The lives of today’s children are often captured, confined, and commoditized on the internet. Because of the unprecedented acceleration of the digital frontier, we may not fully understand the repercussions of this experiment until it is too late. As the most vulnerable and impressionable population in our society, children deserve the highest levels of legal protection.<sup>14</sup>
