## IV. PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS
[32] Upcoming generations deserve protection from voracious data collectors. Several solutions have been offered.<sup>128</sup> Reevaluating the framework by which today‚Äôs social media use and online activity is understood will hopefully contribute to the burgeoning scholarship about online privacy protection. As the previous section outlined, surveillance capitalism fundamentally alters the way we interact online and presents unprecedented problems for Generation Z‚Äîand beyond.<sup>129</sup> Thus, as COPPA enters its third decade, understanding the mechanisms of data collection becomes more pertinent.

##### A. Promulgation of COPPA
[33] As the number of internet-connected devices increases,<sup>130</sup> our concept of the internet will disappear.<sup>131</sup> The sprawl of our internetconnected and online-focused world highlights the need for increased protection for our children. COPPA must evolve with our increasingly connected world:

> [S]ince the enactment of COPPA, the internet has grown and the way data is stored, collected, and disseminated over the internet has become more complex and more prominent. ‚Äò[I]n light of [these] changes in online technology,‚Äô the FTC amended the Rule in 2013 to ‚Äòclarify the scope of the Rule and strengthen its protections for children‚Äôs personal information . . . .‚Äô<sup>132</sup> The amendment modified certain definitions, updated COPPA‚Äôs requirements, and included a new provision regarding data retention and deletion. Despite these efforts to better align COPPA with the potential harms child internet users face, the 2013 revision still falls short in meeting its stated goals of protecting children‚Äôs internet privacy. Accordingly, the need to protect child privacy online remains strong and relevant.<sup>133</sup>

FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips opined:

> [T]he American privacy framework is built upon identifying risks and then designing a solution that balances competing interests. That requires evaluating the sensitivity of the information involved and the potential harms that would result from its collection, use or disclosure, and then creating a solution that will limit these harms while still allowing appropriate use of even sensitive information. With COPPA, rather than trying to protect children by limiting their experience on the Internet, Congress instead created a comprehensive, yet flexible, framework to protect both children‚Äôs privacy and their ability to access interactive content on the Internet.<sup>134</sup>

[34] Before considering additional COPPA amendments, Commissioner Phillips stressed that original intent<sup>135</sup> must be remembered, rulemaking must be ‚Äúgrounded in facts, . . . rather than predicated on unsupported fear or speculation[,]‚Äù and regulation must focus on harmful conduct, not data collection in general.<sup>136</sup> Currently, there are several proposed solutions for online privacy issues that range from the imposition of a fiduciary duty on entities that collect or retain users‚Äô information<sup>137</sup> to banning sexual predators on social media<sup>138</sup> to shifting the regulation to state legislatures.<sup>139</sup>

### B. COPPA‚Äôs Limitations
[35] Several articles‚Äîcoincidentally written by juris doctorate candidates‚Äîaddress the general inefficiency of COPPA and online privacy laws.<sup>140</sup> Perhaps the most notable problem is that kids frequently lie about their age.<sup>141</sup> In 2011, a study found that about 40% of teens lie about their age to access a website or signup for an online account.<sup>142</sup> By 2014, another study found that one-quarter of U.S. children between the ages of 8 and 12 use Facebook.<sup>143</sup> Moreover, children are not the sole falsifiers: parents also help their children circumvent many age-restricted sites.<sup>144</sup>

As a result, many parents now knowingly allow or assist their children in circumventing age restrictions on general‚Äìpurpose sites through lying. By creating this environment, COPPA inadvertently hampers the very population it seeks to assist and forces parents and children to forgo COPPA‚Äôs protection and take greater risks in order to get access to the educational and communication sites they want to be part of their online experiences.‚Äù); *accord* Steven Johnson, *The Bargain at the Heart of the Kid Internet*, THE ATL.

[36] Websites set their minimum age to thirteen primarily because of COPPA‚Äôs restriction. <sup>145</sup> Because websites are seemingly complaint, the FTC has had little incentive to reevaluate COPPA‚Äôs restriction.<sup>146</sup> Consequently, the FTC has not challenged this process, effectively accepting that age disclosure with a minimum age requirement sufficiently complies with COPPA.<sup>147</sup>

[37] Enforcing these restrictions is also an issue.<sup>148</sup> ‚ÄúThe vast ineffectiveness of COPPA, and the failure to adequately enforce it in a manner that promotes its underlying objectives, supports Zuckerberg‚Äôs opinion that a law to regulate teenage data‚Äîif bearing any resemblance to COPPA‚Äîwould likely be unnecessary.‚Äù<sup>149</sup> COPPA‚Äôs enforcement determines its effectiveness: the FTC must be properly equipped to enforce COPPA as legislators continue regulating the ‚ÄúTech Titans.‚Äù<sup>150</sup>

### C. Modest Proposals
[38] In their review of *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism*, Justice Cu√©llar and Professor Huq animadvert on how legal scholars disregard the ambiance of neoteric technology:

> [L]egal scholarship tends to be discrete in its focus and granular in its analysis when it comes to novel technological development. We myopically scrutinize a specific technology, such as social media platforms, machine learning, or the internet of things, and try to understand how that phenomenon relates to existing legal templates. This work is valuable, even essential. But scholars and lawyers can miss the forest for the trees when they consider only parts rather than the integrated whole of the emerging datadriven economy. System-level effects, whether positive or negative, may be missed when discrete technologies or legal changes are analyzed in isolation. Gains or losses that spill over from one domain of human activity to another may be sliced out of the analytic frame. Without a clear sense of how discrete technologies are deployed, legal scholars are left with the feeling that they know something is happening, but they don‚Äôt know what it is.<sup>151</sup>

[39] The issue has been framed, the stage set, the gauntlet laid. The following three proposals address the need for more consumer protection, especially for children, in hopes of advancing the privacy rights conversation. Given the gradual regulation of the internet‚Äôs rapid metamorphosis, these proposals will undoubtedly contain overlooked‚Äîand possibly outdated<sup>152</sup>‚Äîissues in the coming months and years. However, the conversation must continue‚Äînot only to educate the uninformed, but to defend the unaware.

#### 1. Increase the Penalty
[40] Until the monetary penalties exceed the benefit of harboring children‚Äôs behavioral data, companies will continue to violate COPPA. Until then, COPPA penalties will remain as another ‚Äúcost of doing business.‚Äù<sup>153</sup> Discovering the monetary value of children‚Äôs online behavioral data is the main barrier from determining the appropriate penalty.<sup>154</sup> A framework shift from basic data collection to behavioral surplus is required to properly regulate these sites. Without austere penalties, ‚Äúsurveillance capitalists are impelled to pursue lawlessness‚Äù and ‚Äúvigorously lobby to kill online privacy protection . . . because such laws are existential threats to the frictionless flow of behavior surplus.‚Äù<sup>155</sup>

[41] As noted earlier, courts limit an operator‚Äôs civil penalty to $43,280 per violation, though that amount decreases depending on several factors.<sup>156</sup> This amount is simply not enough to dissuade companies from collecting children‚Äôs data.<sup>157</sup> The FTC should raise the amount of each violation in substantial increments until the violations cease. Until the violations stop, the economic presumption is that the revenue generated from children‚Äôs behavior is still higher than the cost of paying the penalty.<sup>158</sup>

As for a basic calculation: 7.5 million violations x $100-$43,280 penalty = $0.75-324.6 billion.

#### 2. Increase the Age
[42] COPPA‚Äôs age minimum should be increased to eighteen.<sup>159</sup> As discussed earlier, the age of thirteen is arbitrary.<sup>160</sup> Common law recognizes the age of eighteen as the age of contractual capacity:

> [U]sing the age of thirteen as the ostensible age of consent for privacy contracting in digital spaces creates an irreconcilable conflict with the minority doctrine in contract law. Contract law has historically considered these concerns of child judgment when crafting its own rules. Since the issue that COPPA . . . address[es] relates to a particular contracting context‚Äîdata privacy and information security contracting‚Äîa logical age of consent is one which mirrors contractual capacity generally. Applying a contract law analysis, the usual age of contractual capacity is eighteen, not thirteen.<sup>161</sup>

[43] Moreover, there is a reason that children cannot vote,<sup>162</sup> enlist in the military,<sup>163</sup> drive,<sup>164</sup> consume tobacco,<sup>165</sup> drink alcohol,<sup>166</sup> or do several other activities:<sup>167</sup> a child‚Äôs capacity to understand consequences develops with time. As such, companies should not exploit children‚Äôs behavioral data until children have turned eighteen. Adults can protect themselves from online manipulation,<sup>168</sup> but society must protect children.

#### 3. Increase the Stakes
[44] The manufacturing of ‚Äúprediction products‚Äù from children‚Äôs behavioral data should be criminalized as another form of child abuse.<sup>169</sup> In the seminal case, *Packingham v. North Carolina*, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on a state‚Äôs law regulating social media sites for the first time.<sup>170</sup> There, the Court held that a North Carolina law prohibiting registered sex offenders from accessing a ‚Äúcommercial social networking Web site‚Äù<sup>171</sup> was too broad and thereby violated the First Amendment.<sup>172</sup> However, the Court noted:

> While we now may be coming to the realization that the Cyber Age is a revolution of historic proportions, we cannot appreciate yet its full dimensions and vast potential to alter how we think, express ourselves, and define who we want to be. The forces and directions of the Internet are so new, so protean, and so far reaching that courts must be conscious that what they say today might be obsolete tomorrow.<sup>173</sup>

[45] The Court further observed that all new technologies, including the internet and social media, will be ‚Äúexploited by the criminal mind‚Äù and ‚Äúbecome instruments used to commit serious crimes.‚Äù<sup>174</sup> The Court suggested that a more narrowly tailored law prohibiting registered sex offenders or other bad actors from abusing children online would not be unconstitutional.<sup>175</sup>

[46] The concurring opinion takes a step further by stating that safeguarding the psychological well-being of a minor is necessary even if laws must contravene constitutional rights.<sup>176</sup> Moreover, States have a compelling interest to prohibit online child abuse because bad actors can‚Äî and will continue to‚Äîuse the internet to exploit children<sup>177</sup> 

[47] Legislators cannot adequately regulate the ‚Äúnew logic of accumulation‚Äù without understanding how online behavioral data are manipulated into ‚Äúprediction products.‚Äù<sup>178</sup> There is already a duty to report any online activity that sexually exploits children.<sup>179</sup> Buying and selling a child‚Äôs online behavioral data is a short slip away from outright child exploitation.<sup>180</sup> The moral disparity between *offline* child exploitation and online child exploitation should be rectified.

#### D. Current Exemplar
[48] The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a current exemplar for how governments should respond to the ascension of surveillance capitalism.<sup>181</sup> California recently passed the CCPA to curtail rampant privacy violations online.<sup>182</sup> The CCPA creates a statutory right for consumers to request any personal information that a business collects, and requires the business to disclose that information to the consumer.<sup>183</sup> Furthermore, the CCPA allows the consumer to opt-out of having such personal information sold to third-parties.<sup>184</sup>

[49] Several key rights are established and protected by CCPA: (1) the right to know what personal information is obtained by companies, (2) the right to delete information companies obtain, (3) the ability to opt out from the sale of their personal information, and (4) the promise that consumers will not be discriminated against for following through with any of these options.<sup>185</sup> Finally, ‚Äúexpress authorization‚Äù is required for a minor consumer‚Äôs personal information to be sold.<sup>186</sup> Given the novelty of this legislation, case law has not clarified what ‚Äúexpress authorization‚Äù requires.<sup>187</sup>
