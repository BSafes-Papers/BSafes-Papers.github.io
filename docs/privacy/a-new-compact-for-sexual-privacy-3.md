## II. ASSESSING THE DAMAGE AND LAW’S RESPONSE

The private sector’s vast reservoirs of intimate information threaten crucial values secured by sexual privacy, and they risk damage to human well-being. This Part takes stock of the fallout. Then, it explores existing legal protections.

### *A. Undermining the Values Secured by Sexual Privacy*

Sexual privacy allows people to manage the boundaries around their intimate lives. <sup>146</sup> With sexual privacy, people enjoy the freedom to go “backstage” to experiment with their bodies, sexuality, and gender.<sup>147</sup> They decide who learns about their innermost fantasies, sexual history, and sexual and reproductive health.

The private sector’s handling of intimate data undermines the values that sexual privacy secures. Firms have jeopardized the autonomy that sexual privacy enables. The dating app Jack’d endangered individuals’ choice to keep their nude photos private by making it easy for strangers to find them online. Grindr negated subscribers’ choice to share intimate information only with potential partners by giving it to advertisers and analytics. There is every reason to believe that subscribers were distressed (to say the least) by the denial of their autonomy.

Private-sector surveillance of intimate information also imperils self-expression and the ability of people to explore new information and ideas.<sup>148</sup> The social conformity theory of chilling effects helps explain why.<sup>149</sup> People may refrain from searching, browsing, and expressing themselves if they perceive their expression and exploration as falling outside the mainstream.<sup>150</sup> For fear that intimate information will be collected and shared in unwanted ways, people will stop visiting sites devoted to gender, sexuality, or sexual health. They will not use periodtracking apps that might help them manage anxiety, pain, and uncertainty.<sup>151</sup> They will stop visiting adult sites that enable “vicarious expression and satisfaction of minority interests that are difficult, embarrassing, and occasionally illegal to indulge in reality.”<sup>152</sup> They might avoid communicating about intimate matters for fear of unwanted exposure.<sup>153</sup> The self-censorship can be more subtle though no less significant. As Jonathon Penney explains, chilling can be more subtle—we may see people change engagement and expression to more socially conforming, mainstream ones rather than experimental, nonmainstream ones.<sup>154</sup>

Public health officials feared this kind of chilling effect after news broke that Grindr had shared its customers’ HIV status with analytics firms.<sup>155</sup> A Grindr subscriber told Vox that he removed his HIV status from his profile after learning about the disclosure. He explained that, “Some people’s jobs may be in jeopardy if the wrong people find out about their status—or maybe they have difficult family situations. It can put people in danger, and it feels like an invasion of privacy.”<sup>156</sup> This example is consistent with studies showing that victims of nonconsensual pornography tend to withdraw from online engagement and expression.<sup>157</sup>

In response to news that analytics firms obtained people’s HIV status from dating sites like Grindr, sexual health researcher Dr. Jeffrey Klausner underscored his concern “this would undermine years of efforts to promote people recording their HIV status in their profile and sharing their status with others to promote safer sex.” *Id*.

The loss of sexual privacy undermines human dignity by changing self-perception. When people realize their intimate life is being observed, tracked, and trafficked, they view themselves as “something seen through another’s eyes.”<sup>158</sup> As Anita Allen explains, privacy invasions risk “form[ing] humiliating, despicable pictures of their victims that interfere with their victims’ self-concepts and self-esteem, making them doubt they are the people they have worked to be.”<sup>159</sup> The loss of sexual privacy also undermines dignity by having others see people as just parts of their intimate lives and not as fully integrated human beings.<sup>160</sup>

When people’s nude photos are posted online without consent, they see themselves as just their genitals or breasts and fear that others will see them that way. For example, in 2018, a young lawyer stayed in a hotel for work.<sup>161</sup> Without her knowledge or permission, a hotel employee placed a camera in the bathroom and recorded her as she showered.<sup>162</sup> The employee posted the video and her personal details on various porn sites.<sup>163</sup> The woman told me that after finding out about the postings, she despaired at seeing herself and at being seen as just a naked body relieving and washing herself.<sup>164</sup>

Private-sector handling of intimate information can jeopardize the trust that is essential for the development of intimate relationships. As Charles Fried argued years ago, privacy is the oxygen for intimacy.<sup>165</sup> Intimacy develops as partners share vulnerable aspects of themselves.<sup>166</sup> Partners must believe that their confidences will be kept not only by their partners but also by the firms handling their intimate information. If people lose faith in the companies facilitating their intimate interactions, then they will stop using their services, to the detriment of the project of intimacy. The loss of trust is profound when sites disclose people’s nude images without consent. People stop dating for fear that future partners will frequent revenge porn sites and porn sites to post their nude photos in violation of their trust and confidence.<sup>167</sup>

Equal opportunity is on the line as well. The surveillance of intimate life is particularly costly to women and marginalized people. Consider the disproportionate impact of sites trafficking in nonconsensual pornography. A majority of the nude images posted online without consent involve women and sexual minorities.<sup>168</sup> Nonconsensual porn impacts women and girls far more frequently than men and boys. Individuals who identify as sexual minorities are more likely than heterosexual individuals to experience threats of, or actual, nonconsensual pornography.<sup>169</sup> As Ari Waldman has found, gay and bisexual male users of geosocial dating apps are more frequently victims of nonconsensual pornography than both the general population and the broader lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities.<sup>170</sup> The damage stems from prevailing stereotypes and the social construction of sexuality. When heterosexual men appear in videos having sex, they are socially empowered by the performance whereas women and sexual minorities are demeaned, disempowered, and viewed as stigmatized.<sup>171</sup>

We see the disproportionate impact on women featured on deep fake sex video sites. According to a 2019 study, 96 percent of all of the 15,000 deep fake videos online are deep fake sex videos and 99 percent of those videos involve inserting women’s faces into porn without consent.<sup>172</sup> In the past year, the number of deep fake sex videos have grown exponentially as have deep fake sex videos featuring women without consent.<sup>173</sup>

Consider the fem-tech market’s potential disproportionate impact on women.<sup>174</sup> According to media reports, some employers and health insurers have access to employees’ period- and fertility-tracking apps. Women’s intimate information could be used to raise the cost of employerprovided health insurance, adjust wages, or scale back employment benefits.<sup>175</sup> It could impact the ability to obtain life insurance, keep jobs, and get promotions. Medical researcher Paula Castano explains that the information tracked by fertility apps raise concerns because they offer little insight as a medical clinical matter and “focus on variables that affect time out of work and insurance utilization.”<sup>176</sup>

If intimate information is shared with data brokers, it could be used in the scoring of individuals, to their detriment. As the Federal Trade Commission explains, data brokers’ scoring processes are not transparent, which means that “individuals cannot take actions to mitigate the impact of negative scores, such as being limited to ads for subprime credit or receiving different levels of service from companies.”<sup>177</sup> “An insurance company could use scoring products to infer that individuals to classify individuals as higher risk.”<sup>178</sup> Scoring products could negatively impact the interest rates charged on loans.<sup>179</sup> News about the disproportionately higher creditworthiness of men as compared to women for Apple’s new credit card demonstrates the point.

Eight of the top ten pornography websites host deepfake pornography, and there are nine deepfake pornography websites hosting 13,254 fake porn videos (mostly featuring female celebrities without their consent). These sites generate income from advertising. Indeed, as the first comprehensive study of deepfake video and audio explains, “deepfake pornography represents a growing business opportunity, with all of these websites featuring some form of advertising.” *Id.; see generally* Chesney & Citron, *supra* note, at.

Reservoirs of intimate information shared with advertisers and sold to data brokers make their way into the hands of vendors who use that data to train algorithms used in hiring, housing, insurance, and other crucial decisions.<sup>180</sup> As more intimate information is collected, used, and shared, the more it will be used to entrench bias. People’s sexual assaults, abortions, painful periods, HIV infections, escort use, extramarital affairs, and porn preferences may be used to train job-recruitment and housing-matching algorithms.<sup>181</sup> A wealth of scholarship and research explores the discriminatory impacts of algorithmic discrimination in the commercial sector.<sup>182</sup> A prevailing concern is that algorithmic tools “replicate historical hierarchies by rendering people along a continuum of least to most valuable.”<sup>183</sup>

The opacity of commercial algorithms makes identifying and challenging discrimination difficult.<sup>184</sup> But examples do exist. Consider, for example, Amazon’s experimental hiring tool that ranked job candidates by learning from data about the company’s past practices. A Reuters story revealed that the hiring algorithm downgraded resumes from candidates who attended all-women’s colleges along with any resume that included the word “women’s.”<sup>185</sup> Amazon abandoned the tool when it could not ensure that it was not free of bias against women.

### *B. Surveying the Harm*

The wide-spread collection, storage, use, and disclosure of intimate information risks emotional, physical, and reputational harm. It makes people vulnerable to manipulation, blackmail, and extortion.<sup>186</sup> The examples of suffering are as plentiful as they are disturbing.

Consider the aftermath of the hack of Ashley Madison for John Gibson, a married father and Baptist minister who was just one of many exposed in the hack. He committed suicide days after the public learned about the hack. Gibson’s wife explained that her husband’s suicide note described his deep shame about having his name on the site. She explained her husband was mourning the loss of his job. As his daughter explained, Gibson resigned—or was urged to resign—after the church learned about the site.<sup>187</sup> “We all have things we struggle with, but it wasn’t so bad that we wouldn’t have forgiven it. But for John, it carried such a shame, and he just couldn’t see that,” she noted.<sup>188</sup> Gibson’s son spoke at his memorial service, noting that shame killed his father.<sup>189</sup> Gibson’s fear about losing his job was well-founded. Victims of sexual-privacy invasions have been fired or encountered great difficulty obtaining work.<sup>190</sup>

Stories abound of scammers using emails and passwords hacked from porn sites to blackmail people. Criminals write to individuals claiming they recorded them watching porn online and demanding money to keep the videos secret. For seven months in 2018, victims lost 332,000 dollars to these scams. More than 89,000 people were targeted, and on average they paid 540 dollars. Increasingly, criminals are targeting high-earning victims, including company executives, doctors, and lawyers.<sup>191</sup>

The national security implications of this kind of activity are also significant. The concentration of sensitive information on dating sites presents an inviting target for governments seeking leverage over political activists, dissidents, or foreign agents.<sup>192</sup> National security experts raised these concerns after the Chinese government bought the gay dating app Grindr.<sup>193</sup> Peter Mattis, a former U.S. government analyst and China specialist, remarked: “What you can see from Chinese intelligence practices is a clear effort to collect a lot of personal information on a lot of different people, and to build a database of names that’s potentially useful either for influence or for intelligence. Then later, when the party-state comes into contact with someone in the database, there’s now information to be pulled.”<sup>194</sup>

Criminals and hostile states are not the only ones who exploit intimate information in ways that undermine people’s well-being. When companies use people’s acute emotional fragility or membership in a protected class to override their wishes, their actions can be viewed as a “dark pattern.”<sup>195</sup>“The Spinner” exemplifies the troubling nature of dark patterns. It promises to bend the will of people’s intimate partners with its advertising services. The online service sends innocent-looking links to people via text that, when clicked, creates cookies that send targeted advertisements.<sup>196</sup> The company claims to have swayed people to get back together, to initiate sex, and to settle their divorces. The company’s most requested service is its “initiating sex campaign,” which sends ads trumpeting reasons why people should initiate sex.

Another illustration of troubling manipulation is period-tracking app FEMM, which uses subscribers’ intimate information to dissuade them from terminating their pregnancies. An anti-abortion group runs the app, but it does not tell that to subscribers.<sup>197</sup> The app’s marketing materials simply say: “Are you looking to track your menstrual cycles and symptoms, get pregnant or avoid pregnancy? The FEMM app is more than just a period tracker: it provides you with cutting edge science that helps you keep track of your health, understand what is going on with your body, flag potential issues and connect with a network of doctors and nurses to provide you the best health care. We’re a new revolution in women’s health!”<sup>198</sup> The app provides materials claiming that birth control is unsafe and highlighting information that promotes pregnancy. The app misleads subscribers about its motives and propagates misinformation.

### *C. Understanding the Legal Landscape*

In the United States, information privacy law does little to curtail the private sector’s amassing of vast amounts of intimate information, at least outside the provision of health care.<sup>199</sup> It generally presumes the propriety of commercial collection of personal data.<sup>200</sup> As William McGeveran explains in his influential privacy casebook, American law treats the processing of personal data as both inevitable and pro-social.<sup>201</sup>

#### 1. Privacy Legislation

American privacy law generally does not curtail data collection.<sup>202</sup>Instead, it focuses on procedural protections, such as ensuring the transparency of corporate data practices (referred to as notice) and securing certain rights over personal data (referred to as choice).<sup>203</sup> Even its more reform-oriented elements sometimes continue this trend. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CPPA), enacted in 2018, for example, gives consumers the right to know what personal information has been collected and to opt-out of its sale.<sup>204</sup>

<sup>199</sup> The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 is the rare exception. It limits the collection of children’s online information to instances where parents have explicitly provided consent. Similarly, in the EU, the GDPR protects information pertaining to individuals’ “sex life” as sensitive information, precluding its collection except upon explicit consent.

So long as companies post privacy policies and offer opt-out rights under state law, they can largely collect, use, and sell intimate information without limitation.<sup>205</sup> It should therefore not be a surprise that Grindr’s privacy policy warns that its advertising partners “may be collecting information from you.”<sup>206</sup> The fem-tech market is doing the same. A recent study showed that ten popular fem-tech apps including Clue sold subscribers’ personal information to at least 135 companies.<sup>207</sup> Individuals should not be reassured if companies pledge to de-identify intimate information before selling it. Intimate information can be easily reidentified when combined with other information.<sup>208</sup>

Under federal and state law, companies must store intimate information in a reasonably secure manner. Legal obligations stem from data security,<sup>209</sup> data disposal,<sup>210</sup> encryption,<sup>211</sup> breach notification,<sup>212</sup> and unfair and deceptive acts and practice (UDAP) laws.<sup>213</sup> Companies may have a duty to adopt certain data security practices, such as having a comprehensive data-security program addressing potential risks to consumers.<sup>214</sup> As explored below, companies have faced suit for inadequately securing intimate information.

<sup>204</sup> CAL. CIV. CODE § 1798.100, 1798.105, 1798.110, 1798.120 (West 2018).

One might assume think privacy law limits all of the private sector’s collection of intimate information related to health conditions. The crucial protections of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), however, only cover data collected during the provision of health care and not health data generally. HIPAA is a health care portability law with privacy protections, not a health privacy bill. It covers particular healthcare providers (known as covered entities), such as medical practices, hospitals, and health insurance companies.<sup>215</sup> HIPAA, for instance, requires that covered entities obtain consent before using or disclosing individually identifiable “protected health information.” That provision does not apply to the broad array of non-covered entities, including fem-tech apps, search engines, medical information sites, or dating sites.<sup>216</sup> When a dating app collects information about individuals’ HIV status or when a femtech app stores the dates of abortions and miscarriages, it is not constrained by HIPAA’s privacy rules.

#### 2. Privacy Policymaking of Law Enforcers
In the rare case, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state Attorneys General (AG) have set norms around the collection and storage of intimate information.<sup>217</sup> Federal and state UDAP laws provide support for this activity.<sup>218</sup> The following examples provide precedent for entities handling intimate information in the relevant jurisdictions.

***
<sup>215</sup> In passing HIPAA in 1996, Congress delegated authority to the Department of Health and Human Services to enact national data privacy or confidentiality and data security standards. Allen, supra note, at 113-14. DHHS issued its Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information known as the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 45 CFR 164.524. The HIPAA Privacy Rule, enacted in 2000, applies only to covered entities— healthcare providers who engage in certain electronic healthcare transactions, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses like hospital billing providers and insurers. Id.
{: .fs-2}
<sup>216</sup> Period-tracking apps Ovia claims to comply with HIPAA, surely due to the fact that the company shares de-identified data with employers who provide health insurance to employees. Harwell, supra note, at.
{: .fs-2}
<sup>217</sup> Danielle Keats Citron, *The Privacy Policymaking of State Attorneys General,* 92 NOTRE DAME L. REV. 747 (2016). The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also has the authority to regulate abusive conduct, at least within the banking and financial services sector. Under 12 U.S.C. 5531, an abusive practice is one that materially interferes with the ability of consumers to understand a term or condition of a “consumer financial product or service” or takes unreasonable advantage of their understanding of such a service or product’s material risks or of their inability to protect their interests.

The Massachusetts Attorney General’s office has considered the collection of information about women’s visits to abortion clinics, inferred from geolocation data, to constitute an unfair and deceptive business practice. In 2015, an advertising company in Brookline, Massachusetts was hired to bombard “abortion-minded women” with pro-life advertisements as they visited certain health providers.<sup>219</sup> Geofencing technology was key to the effort. It let the advertising company target women’s cell phones as they entered “Planned Parenthood clinic[s], hospitals, doctor’s offices that perform abortions.”<sup>220</sup> Women saw ads entitled “Pregnancy Help,” “You Have Choices,” and “You’re Not Alone” that linked to live web chats with a “pregnancy support specialist.”<sup>221</sup> Once an individual’s device had been tagged, then that person would continue to see pro-life ads for the next thirty days.<sup>222</sup>

The Massachusetts AG’s office viewed the company’s collection of location data to infer women’s reproductive health as constituting an unfair and deceptive business practice.<sup>223</sup> For the Massachusetts AG, the advertising firm intruded upon a “consumer’s private health or medical affairs or status” resulting in the “gathering or dissemination of private health or medical facts about the consumer without his or her consent.”<sup>224</sup>

***
<sup>218</sup> The Federal Trade Commission has enforcement authority to police unfair and deceptive commercial acts and practices under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Id. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, state lawmakers followed the federal government’s lead in adopting so-called baby Section 5 acts, that is, UDAP laws. With this authority, state attorneys general have served as crucial privacy norm entrepreneurs using their authority under state UDAP laws. *Id*. I had the great fortune of witnessing creative state AG privacy policymaking in advising then-California AG Kamala Harris from 2014 to 2016. *Id*.

The advertising company and the AG’s office entered into a settlement agreement under which the company vowed not to use geofencing technology near medical centers or physician offices to infer people’s health status, medical condition, or medical treatment.<sup>225</sup> Although the agreement is enforceable only against this specific advertising company (one of the limits of governance by settlement agreements), it established a norm against the collection of geolocation data to infer consumers’ reproductive health data under Massachusetts law.<sup>226</sup>

In another effort to curtail the collection of intimate data, the FTC sued mobile spyware company Retina-X under its UDAP authority in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.<sup>227</sup> The complaint alleged that defendant’s spyware injured consumers by enabling stalkers to monitor people’s physical movements, sensitive information, and online activities without consent.<sup>228</sup> The unwanted collection of cellphone activity risked exposing victims to emotional distress, financial losses, and physical  harm,including death.<sup>229</sup> The FTC charged that the mobile spyware constituted an unfair practice because consumers could not reasonably avoid the secret spying and the harm was not outweighed by the countervailing benefits.<sup>230</sup> In 2019, the FTC entered into a consent decree with Retina-X. The defendant agreed to obtain express written agreement from purchasers that they would use the product only for legitimate and lawful purposes.<sup>231</sup> Regrettably, the defendant was not required to refrain from selling monitoring products in the future, a result that shows another of the limits of governance by consent decree.

State and federal enforcement efforts have set important precedent regarding sites amassing people’s nude images as part of extortion schemes. In her capacity as California’s Attorney General, Kamala Harris prosecuted operators of sites that encouraged users to post nude photos and then charged for their removal.<sup>232</sup> In one case, site operator Kevin Bollaert faced charges of extortion, conspiracy, and identity theft after urging users to post ex-lovers’ nude photos and offering to remove those images for hundreds of dollars. Bollaert was convicted of 27 felony counts and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and ten years of mandatory supervision.<sup>233</sup>

The FTC sued another revenge porn operator under Section 5 of the FTC Act for exploiting nude images shared in confidence for commercial gain.<sup>234</sup> The operator agreed to shutter the site and delete the images.<sup>235</sup> The FTC joined forces with the Nevada Attorney General in an investigation of yet another revenge porn site that solicited nude images and charged victims from $499 to $2,800 for their removal.<sup>236</sup> A federal court ordered the site to destroy all intimate images and personal information in its possession and to pay more than $2 million in penalties.<sup>237</sup>

Norms around data security have similarly emerged based on federal and state enforcement activity. The FTC follows a process-based approach to data security, which entails assessing steps taken by entities to achieve “reasonable security.”<sup>238</sup> State attorneys general, adhering to this approach, often serve as “first responders” to data breaches, at times in coordination with the FTC.<sup>239</sup>

The FTC and state attorneys general have brought investigations in the wake of data breaches involving intimate information. For instance, the FTC and the Vermont Attorney General’s office sued the owners of Ashley Madison for failing to adequately secure customers’ personal data. The Vermont AG’s complaint highlighted the site’s failure to maintain information security policy and to use multi-factor authentication.<sup>240</sup> The complaint alleged that the site’s inadequate security amounted to an unfair business practice that risked “significant harm to consumers’ reputation, relationships, and personal life” and raised people’s risk of identity theft. The case resulted in a consent decree with the FTC and settlements with state Attorneys General.

The New York Attorney General’s office similarly investigated Jack’d, a gay, bisexual, and transgender dating app, for failing to protect the nude images of approximately 1,900 individuals.<sup>241</sup> The dating app allegedly deceived customers by breaking its promise to ensure the confidentiality of photos marked “private.” Although the site had been warned about the security vulnerability more than a year earlier, it had failed to take remedial action.

#### 3. Private Suits
Civil suits have gained traction for deceptive collections of intimate information related to networked sex toys. Subscribers sued vibrator manufacturer Lovense for collecting intimate information despite its promise that “absolutely no sensitive data (pictures, video, chat logs) pass through (or are held) on our servers.”<sup>242</sup> The complaint alleged that the defendant intruded on the plaintiffs’ privacy by recording their communications and activities without consent in violation of the federal and state wiretap laws and state privacy tort law.<sup>243</sup> Subscribers brought similar claims against We-Vibe for recording information about their use of the defendant’s vibrators.<sup>244</sup> The case settled for 3.75 million dollars.

By contrast, individuals have been unable to hold platforms accountable for hosting their nude images without consent.<sup>245</sup> Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act (CDA) has barred their efforts.<sup>246</sup> The irony is significant—the CDA was principally concerned with censoring porn (and was mostly struck down), yet the only part of the law left standing now enables the distribution of the very worst kinds of obscenity and hateful expression. Under Section 230, providers or users of interactive computer services are shielded from liability for under- or over-filtering user-generated content.<sup>247</sup> Section 230(c)(1) says that providers or users of interactive computer services will not be “treated as publishers or speakers” for information provided by another information content provider.<sup>248</sup>

Lower federal and state courts have dismissed victims’ civil claims even though site operators solicited, chose to republish, or failed to remove nonconsensual pornography.<sup>249</sup> Section 230 did not bar the state AG and FTC suits discussed above because they concerned site operators’ own extortion schemes, not their publication of user-generated content.<sup>250</sup>

Individuals have sued companies for failing to properly secure personal information. Companies have faced lawsuits in the wake of data breaches, but those suits are often dismissed early on in the litigation due to plaintiffs’ lack of standing or cognizable harm under state law.<sup>251</sup> Those lawsuits have a greater likelihood of surviving motions to dismiss if plaintiffs have suffered financial harm like identity theft, as opposed to the increased risk of such harm.<sup>252</sup>

One might think anti-discrimination law would serve as a crucial tool to preventing the use of discriminatory hiring algorithms in employment decisions. The major barrier to private civil rights claims (or even federal and state enforcement actions) is the opacity of vendors’ proprietary systems. Hiring AI systems may be mining intimate information in ways that have a disparate impact on individuals from protected groups but it has been impossible to detect and thus private suits are hard to pursue.<sup>253</sup>

#### 4. Criminal Law
Only a narrow set of commercial practices—spyware and cyberstalking apps—implicate the criminal law. As I have explored in prior work, Title III of the Wiretap Act includes a provision covering those involved in the manufacture, sale, and advertisement of covert surveillance devices.<sup>254</sup> Congress passed that provision, 18 U.S.C. 2512, to “dry up” the source of equipment that is highly useful for private nonconsensual surveillance.<sup>255</sup>

Section 2512 makes it a crime to intentionally manufacture, sell, or advertise a device knowing or having reason to know that its design renders it “primarily useful” for the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications.<sup>256</sup> Defendants face fines of up to $10,000, up to five years imprisonment, or both. Section 2512 covers a “narrow category of devices whose principal use is likely to be for wiretapping or eavesdropping.”<sup>257</sup> Twenty-five states and the District of Columbia have similar statutes.<sup>258</sup>

Nonetheless, prosecutions remain rare. Despite the prevalence of spyware and the hundreds of purveyors of cyber stalking apps, federal prosecutors have only brought a handful of cases. In September 2014, federal prosecutors brought Section 2512 charges against StealthGenie’s CEO Hammad Akbar.<sup>259</sup> StealthGenie’s spyware app secretly intercepted communications to and from mobile phones.<sup>260</sup> The federal indictment alleged that the app’s target population was “spousal cheat: Husband/Wife or boyfriend/girlfriend suspecting their other half of cheating or any other suspicious behavior or if they just want to monitor them.”<sup>261</sup> A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order authorizing the FBI to disable the site hosting StealthGenie.<sup>262</sup> The defendant pleaded guilty to the charges and was ordered to pay $500,000 in fines.<sup>263</sup> There have been no subsequent reported federal criminal cases against spyware purveyors since the StealGenie case. At the state level, prosecutions have been virtually nonexistent.<sup>264</sup>

While criminal law provides a foothold for the prosecution of the manufacturers, it has been hampered by the requirement that the device be primarily designed for the secret interception of electronic communications.<sup>265</sup> As privacy advocate James Dempsey argued and as prosecutors have confirmed, the small number of prosecutions under Section 2512 is attributable to the fact that it is hard to demonstrate that equipment is primarily designed for stealth interception of communications.<sup>266</sup>

Individual sexual-privacy invaders are a different matter, as my prior scholarship has explored.<sup>267</sup> Consider nonconsensual pornography. Today, 46 states, D.C., and Guam criminalize the posting of nude photos without consent.<sup>268</sup> Law enforcement has been slowly but surely pursuing cases under those laws.
