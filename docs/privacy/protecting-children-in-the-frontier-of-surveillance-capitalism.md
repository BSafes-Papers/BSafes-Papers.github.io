J.D. Candidate, 2021, Texas A&M Univ. School of Law; B.A., 2016, Univ. of Texas at Austin. This paper is dedicated to my soon-to-be-born son: you are fiercely loved. Many thanks to my wife and family for encouraging me through this process. To Ivan Escobar, Josh Jones, Ryan Cairns, and Christian Albuquerque: thank you for your much-needed insights and much-appreciated Bluebook knowledge. To the Richmond JOLT Editorial Staff: your comments and editing skills were invaluable. All errors, omissions, and missed steaks are my own.”<br>

>*“Come senators, congressmen Please heed the call Don’t stand in the doorway Don’t block up the hall For he that gets hurt Will be he who has stalled There’s a battle outside and it is ragin’ It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls For the times they are a-changin’”<sup>1</sup>*
