*This paper presents a qualitative study, consisting of six focus groups organized according to the age of participants, on public attitudes surrounding the right to privacy. Several major findings emerged from these focus groups, including qualitative evidence that suggests that age does not play a major role in respondents’ attitudes toward privacy. Based upon these findings and other patterns in respondents’ attitudes, we advance a theory that relates people’s opinions on the value of privacy within society writ large to their perceptions of an individual’s ability to protect his or her personal information. Finally, we conclude by speculating about a new conception of privacy—one that may comport with a world where the pace of technological innovation is extraordinary.*
