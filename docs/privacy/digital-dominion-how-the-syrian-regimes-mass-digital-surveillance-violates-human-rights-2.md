## II. Factual Background: Telecommunications Infrastructure and Key Players
The internet provides an essential platform for populations and governments to communicate, share ideas, and access essential information, services and networks. Much of today’s communication, organizing, and collaboration happens on digital networks, through email, Voice-over-Internet Protocol applications and services (VoIP-like WhatsApp), social media accounts, and online platforms. As of 2010, almost 2 billion people around the world had access to the internet through computers or mobile devices.<sup>7</sup> In 2010, only 17.7% of the Syrian population, or 3.9 million individuals, had access to the internet.<sup>8</sup> This number has dropped significantly over the last ten years. In 2020, only 4.2% of the Syrian population had access to the internet.<sup>9</sup> Syria ranked as 12th out of 14 Middle Eastern countries, in terms of population percentage that uses the internet.<sup>10</sup> The number of mobile users or connections is significantly higher. As of January 2020, according to Data Reportal, the number of mobile internet users was 5.75 million, or 31% of the total population.<sup>11</sup> Mobile phones have played a key role in

Syria, “enabling ‘citizen journalists’ to capture events on the ground…[which] have served as a crucial source of information on the uprising.”<sup>12</sup> Social media and other platforms are primarily used to disseminate information, to follow unfolding events, and to voice opinions and support for movements or ideas.<sup>13</sup>

### A. The Infrastructure of Surveillance 
The Syrian telecommunications market is the most restricted and regulated among all Middle Eastern countries, based on the percentage of State-owned telecommunications infrastructure.<sup>14</sup> The state-owned Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (“STE”) is both an internet service provider (ISP) and the official telecommunications regulator. STE has a monopoly over wired and wireless services throughout the regime controlled areas of the country.<sup>15</sup> While the state has licensed to other smaller private providers, these providers rely on government infrastructure and are subject to state regulations.<sup>16</sup> Through this control, the regime not only censors information based on political, social, and religious beliefs, but can also conduct surveillance of internet users in Syria.<sup>17</sup> In essence, the STE provides the government control over what content the population can and cannot interact with on the internet. 

In 2007, Nazem Bahsas, the head of the STE, solicited bids from companies to build a new “Central Monitoring System for public data networks and the Internet.”<sup>18</sup> In 2008, the Syrian government solicited more requests for bids to build its surveillance system,<sup>19</sup> which would be a content filtering system<sup>20</sup> combatting politically inopportune speech.<sup>21</sup> Content filtering allows for the analysis of communication data packets through key words or attributes, which can then be stored for further analysis, blocked, or allowed to pass through without being stored. Alarmingly, Bahsas requested and clarified that this new system would be centralized so that it could have the capability of monitoring all telecommunications data inside Syria.<sup>22</sup> Additionally, Bahsas demanded real time location tracking ability of up to fifty targets and that the monitoring be completely undetected by the Syrians who are being monitored.<sup>23</sup> In other words, the Syrian regime sought the capability to select any Syrian individual for any reason, monitor every website they visit, track their mobile device to determine their real time location, and do all of this without the individual knowing they are being tracked.<sup>24</sup> While the STE claimed this authority was needed to ensure system security from hacking and foreign and domestic infiltration, the power to surveille that this system delivered for the regime and the subsequent targeting, torture and killing of dissenters tells a different story.<sup>25</sup>

In December 2008, the Syrian regime explained to prospective bidders that it was not interested in combating “classic spam.”<sup>26</sup> Rather, it was concerned with “propaganda mail which has the shape of spam.”<sup>27</sup> Within the context of the state-run STE system, this is troubling. Because the government has the power to determine what

constitutes “propaganda mail”, it has the authority to impose severe censorship on those it deems critical of or a threat to the regime. Furthermore, since the network infrastructure is completely run by the government, Syrian individuals have no opportunity to view content deemed as “propaganda mail” nor to decide for themselves whether to view it or not.<sup>28</sup>

According to Fredric Jacobs, a researcher that spent time in Syria, “[e]very single piece of traffic that goes through [the Syrian network] is being recorded to hard disk drives.”<sup>29</sup> These drives are controlled and stockpiled by the Syrian regime.<sup>30</sup> Throughout the Syrian conflict that began in 2011, reports<sup>31</sup> surfaced indicating that the regime monitored and tracked human rights defenders through digital surveillance in order to arbitrarily arrest, detain, torture, and kill them as a result of their resistance.<sup>32</sup>

Mobile phone access is much more prevalent, making mobile service providers a key part of the telecommunications infrastructure. An estimated 55 percent of the country’s cellular market is dominated by Syriatel, a regime affiliated provider.<sup>33</sup> MTN Syria is the other major mobile service provider, a subsidiary of South African MTN. As outlined in Section IV below, MTN is subject to government regulation and has complied with government orders when it comes to filtering and blocking telecommunications of its users. The regime access to and surveillance of mobile phones is particularly consequential given the role mobile phones, in the hands of activists and human rights defenders, has come to play in bearing witness to the Civil War and ongoing violence in Syria. “The mobile phone has become the star of the popular revolutions…This small instrument has actually become stronger than the television cameras.”<sup>34</sup> Where outside observers and the international media fail to gain access to the country and local reporters and journalists are targeted and silenced, the citizen journalist has become the main witness and recorder of the situation in Syria.

### B. Regime Intelligence Agencies 
There are four main intelligence agencies in Syria, military and civilian. Their leadership and scope of operations is difficult to precisely identify as these agencies are secretive and the political situation is in constant state of flux.<sup>35</sup> The four agencies are: (1) The Department of Military Intelligence; (2) The Air Force Intelligence Directorate; (3) The General Intelligence Directorate; and (4) The Political Security Directorate.<sup>36</sup> The Military Intelligence and Air Force Intelligence fall under the Ministry of Defense. The General Intelligence Directorate and the Political Security Directorate fall under the remit of the Ministry of Interior. Each agency has multiple branches. The Department of Military Intelligence alone has 20 different branches. This means there are countless intelligence branches with responsibilities ranging from surveilling and controlling military and security

officers, to monitoring and surveilling opposition forces, as well as monitoring and targeting civilian activists and critics. 

Within the Department of Military Intelligence there are a number of branches focusing on civilian surveillance and associated operations. For example, according to one report, there is Branch 211 within Military Intelligence, also known as the “Technical Branch or the Automatic Computer Branch or simply the Computer Branch.”<sup>37</sup> This Branch monitors online activity and is involved in the blocking and unblocking of websites as well as providing support services to other surveillance branches, including Branch 225. 

Branch 225, referred to as the “Communication Branch,” is also part of the Department of Military Intelligence, though it’s current placement within the state architecture is unclear. Branch 225 focuses on phone communications. It can “[block] specific numbers or [cut] off calls or [disable] SMS services.”<sup>38</sup> The Branch can tap phones and surveille mobile phone communications. The Branch can stop a text message once it has been sent but before it arrives to the designated number. Some reports suggest that Branch 225 also monitors internet communications and is at the forefront of the regime’s surveillance activities.<sup>39</sup> According to the Violations Documentation Center in Syria, this Branch has ballooned into a full department, affiliated with the Communications Department, and drawing officers from all four intelligence agencies.<sup>40</sup> 

These surveillance divisions are part of a larger state architecture of military and security forces involved in the arrest, detention, torture and killing of the Syrian people.

### C. The Syrian Electronic Army and Third-Party Hacking 

The state infrastructure of surveillance is further supplemented by the monitoring and hacking performed by state affiliated third-party hacking groups.<sup>41</sup> These hacking groups are predominately referred to as “state-sponsored hackers.”<sup>42</sup> State-sponsored hackers is a term used broadly to refer to hackers that are aligned with a government.<sup>43</sup> While the prevailing term is “state-sponsored hackers,” this report refers to the Syrian Malware Team (“SMT”) and Syrian Electronic Army (“SEA”) as “state-sanctioned hackers” in order to more clearly reflect the nature of the relationship. The two most prominent state-sanctioned hackers in Syria are the SEA and the

SMT.<sup>44</sup> While some reports refer to these two organizations as the same entity, others differentiate the two.<sup>45</sup> SEA is known to be directly linked to the Syrian regime. The exact nature of SMT’s connection to SEA and the regime is up for debate. For example, certain members of the SMT have ties to the SEA. Connections like this suggest that the SMT may be a possible offshoot or part of the SEA.<sup>46</sup> Although the extent of their entanglement may be disputed, it is undeniable that both groups provide support to the Syrian regime.<sup>47</sup> In 2011, Assad affirmed the SEA’s existence and that its work benefits the Syrian army, calling them the “real army in virtual reality.”<sup>48</sup> 

In 2011, following anti-government demonstrations and Assad vowing to quash his “opponents with an iron fist” through violence and surveillance, the SEA thanked him for recognizing them and their role in the suppression of dissenters.<sup>49</sup> The SEA warned anti-regime media, “our message to the news agencies and reporters: if you have a shortage of professionals to report the correct news … the hordes of the Syrian Electronic Army will not be forgiving with you.”<sup>50</sup> After the SEA released this message, the group continued to target opponents of the regime.<sup>51</sup>

One of the first internationally recognized targets of the SEA was Harvard University.<sup>52</sup> There, the SEA hacked the Harvard homepage and replaced it with an image of Bashar al-Assad and wrote the message: “Syrian Electronic Army were here.”<sup>53</sup> The SEA then accused the United States of actively working to overthrow the Syrian government.<sup>54</sup> This anti-U.S. message along with other consistent SEA attacks, and the hacking of Harvard’s website, led Harvard University to investigate the domain name of the SEA.<sup>55</sup> Investigation results indicated that the SEA was created by the Syrian Computer Society; a group that was created by Bashar alAssad prior to him assuming power.<sup>56</sup> The Syrian Computer Society was instrumental in providing the platform for the SEA to accomplish their hacking goals.<sup>57</sup>

The Harvard University hack was only the beginning of SEA’s infiltration of foreign entities through hacking. Between 2011 and 2014, the SEA vandalized numerous other websites, including Forbes, CNBC, The Telegraph, The Chicago Tribune, Human Rights Watch, and UNICEF.58 A message on the homepage of Human

Rights Watch, an NGO dedicated to documenting abuses of human rights in Syria and around the world, said “Syrian Electronic Army Was Here. All Your reports are FALSE!!! Stop lying!!!”<sup>59</sup>

In order to gain access to these websites, the SEA utilized “phishing.”<sup>60</sup> While “spear phishing” is targeted towards an individual, often using personal information, “phishing” targets a large group of individuals in an attempt to steal information.<sup>61</sup> In these SEA phishing attacks, hackers sent emails to news outlets and organizations with links embedded with malware capable of transmitting location and intercepting communications.<sup>62</sup> Once the user opened the link, malware installed itself onto the computer or electronic device.<sup>63</sup>

This phishing technique was used by the SEA to hack into the Associated Press (“AP”). After successfully phishing an AP employee, SEA hackers then used the AP’s twitter account to publish a false news story, “Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.”<sup>64</sup> Fortunately, the tweet was quickly determined to be baseless, but the damage had already been done. The initial panic caused by the fake tweet resulted in a loss of “$136 billion in equity market value.”<sup>65</sup> Further, the SEA has successfully used these phishing techniques to gain access to the websites of The New York Times, the United Nations Human Rights Council, and Microsoft.<sup>66</sup> One of the SEA hackers, a Syrian national called Peter Romar, was arrested and convicted for participating in these attacks.<sup>67</sup>

The SEA also directed its capabilities and gained access to information on regime opponents and critics within Syria. The SEA shared information of anti-Assad activists’ meeting locations and identities directly with the Syrian regime. For example, in 2013 SEA members hacked into the messaging app “Tango” and stole the personal phone numbers, email addresses and contact information for millions of people.<sup>68</sup> While Tango acknowledged a data breach, it did not confirm the extent of the information stolen, nor the method the SEA used to access the data.<sup>69</sup> After obtaining the Tango information, the SEA announced that it would be “handing the information over to its country’s government”— the regime. Experts expressed concern that this would almost certainly lead to people being hurt or worse.<sup>70</sup> The SEA also obtained sensitive data about individual activists through other social media platforms and messaging apps.<sup>71</sup> This sensitive data included, people’s birthdays, personal serial numbers, ID cards, CVs, and blood types.<sup>72</sup>

SEA has used SMT malware, which some speculate has been developed with some assistance from Russia and/or Iran.<sup>73</sup> SMT malware is capable of remotely turning on a target’s phone or computer and extracting files, contact lists, location data, passwords, and, in some cases, has the ability to copy all contents and programs on a user’s phone.<sup>74</sup> One expert noted, “the minute you download this it will take control over your computer…[it] can turn on your phone camera, it can extract files” from any electronic device it is installed on.<sup>75</sup> While the older SEA monitoring techniques featured short, abrupt—often unsophisticated—messages accompanying the attack, alerting the user;<sup>76</sup> the new malware runs and functions like professional, legitimate programs, resulting in the user being less likely to know they are being monitored or had any sensitive information stolen.<sup>77</sup>

### D. Mass Surveillance and Persecution 
The regime controlled telecommunications infrastructure and a drove of state and state-sanctioned surveillance forces have empowered the Assad regime to conduct indiscriminate mass digital surveillance of the Syrian population.<sup>78</sup> The Syrian Ministry of Communications has created a network that allows the government nearly complete authority over the internet.<sup>79</sup> The regime monitors all online activity and websites for any content that is anti-regime.<sup>80</sup> As Section IV below shows, the regime then uses any content that it deems “revolutionary” to persecute critics and human rights defenders.<sup>81</sup> The vast and comprehensive scale at which this digital surveillance has occurred and is occurring inside Syria should be a great cause of concern for the international community as a whole. 

Section III outlines the human rights implicated by mass surveillance. While the rights of all Syrian people, especially anyone critical of the regime, are endangered and have been breached as a result of surveillance, the rights of human rights defenders have been disproportionately impacted. The right to privacy, freedom of expression and of participation, the right to life and freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment are all at stake in the regime’s, and its affiliated groups’, campaign of surveillance and persecution. Section IV identifies how the infrastructure of surveillance together with an enabling legal framework has led to censorship, monitoring, hacking and detention of journalists, activists and human rights defenders.
