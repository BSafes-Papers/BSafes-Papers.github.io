## II. RECLAIMING PRIVACY
[6] Privacy is a long-established right.<sup>15</sup> However, in comparison, consumer protection rights are relatively new. <sup>16</sup> President Woodrow Wilson created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914 to prevent unfair competition.<sup>17</sup> Operating within this framework, additional legislation broadened the FTC’s regulatory power to protect the privacy rights of consumers by prohibiting deceptive practices involving consumers' personal information.<sup>18</sup>

### A. History of COPPA
[7] Toward the end of the twentieth century, as more children began accessing the internet, Congress enacted the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).19 COPPA requires the FTC to issue and enforce regulations concerning online privacy for children under the age of thirteen.<sup>20</sup> COPPA’s strives to provide parental control over information collected from their children online.<sup>21</sup> COPPA applies to operators of commercial websites for kids and websites that act with an “actual knowledge” that they are collecting, using, or disclosing “personal information”<sup>22</sup> from children under the age of thirteen.<sup>23</sup> Operators must post a clear privacy policy, obtain verifiable parental consent, provide parents access to delete their child’s information, and maintain the confidentiality of collected information.<sup>24</sup> After the retained personal information has fulfilled its intended purpose, operators must destroy the information to prevent unauthorized access.<sup>25</sup>

[8] COPPA does not apply to information collected about children, only from children.<sup>26</sup> However, the FTC fully expects operators to confidentially secure any information obtained from parents in the course of obtaining parental consent.<sup>27</sup> Regarding teenage users, the FTC further explains:

> In enacting [COPPA], Congress determined to apply the statute’s protections only to children under 13, recognizing that younger children are particularly vulnerable to overreaching by marketers and may not understand the safety and privacy issues created by the online collection of personal information. Although COPPA does not apply to teenagers, the FTC is concerned about teen privacy and does believe that strong, more flexible, protections may be appropriate for this age group.<sup>28</sup>

[9] COPPA does not inhibit a child’s access to certain websites thereby leaving a child’s parent or school responsible for filtering internet access.<sup>29</sup> Violators of COPPA can be liable for civil penalties up to $43,280 per violation depending on “the egregiousness of the violations, whether the operator has previously violated [COPPA], the number of children involved, the amount and type of personal information collected, how the information was used, whether it was shared with third parties, and the size of the company.”<sup>30</sup> Foreign-based websites must also comply with COPPA as do U.S.-based websites that collect information from foreign children.<sup>31</sup>

### B. Ongoing Privacy Violations
[10] Online privacy violations continue to occur as companies disregard consumer protection laws.<sup>32</sup> Although tech companies pay tremendous amounts of money to settle allegations with the FTC, the quasi-punishment these companies may not fit the alleged violation<sup>33</sup> Furthermore, unknown and upcoming companies are just as likely to violate privacy protection laws as the “Tech Titans.”<sup>34</sup>

#### 1. Facebook’s FTC Settlement
[11] Facebook’s recent settlement with the FTC illuminates the degradation of consumers’ online privacy. Based on allegations that Facebook violated its 2012 FTC privacy order, Facebook assented to an unprecedented $5 billion settlement with the FTC.<sup>35</sup> Referring to the settlement, FTC Chairman, Joe Simons, stated that “[t]he relief is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook’s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations.”<sup>36</sup> The Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice Civil Division reiterated that “[t]he Department of Justice is committed to protecting consumer data privacy and ensuring that social media companies like Facebook do not mislead individuals about the use of their personal information.”<sup>37</sup> The FTC determined that “Facebook repeatedly used deceptive disclosures and settings to undermine users’ privacy preferences” in violation of a previous FTC order.<sup>38</sup> Facebook failed to inform its users that third-party apps collected data from Facebook users’ “friends” without receiving proper consent.<sup>39</sup> To ensure future compliance, the FTC order established an independent privacy committee of Facebook’s board of directors thereby curtailing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s adamantine control.<sup>40</sup> These amendments are now included in the 2012 FTC privacy order.<sup>41</sup>

#### 2. YouTube and Other Violators
[12] In 2019, YouTube paid $170 million to settle allegations by the FTC that the company illegally collected personal information from children without their parents’ consent.<sup>42</sup> Persistent identifiers—or “cookies”—were used to track children who viewed child-directed channels across the internet without first notifying parents and receiving meaningful consent.<sup>43</sup> Even though several channel owners directed their content to children—and despite YouTube marketing its popularity with children to prospective corporate clients—YouTube refused to acknowledge that it violated COPPA.<sup>44</sup>

[13] Channel owners can monetize their channel by allowing YouTube to disseminate “behaviorally targeted advertisements” to their viewers.<sup>45</sup> According to the FTC complaint, even though YouTube manually reviewed children’s content in its “YouTube Kids” application, it still collected a child’s personal data to display targeted advertisements on these channels.<sup>46</sup> Despite the ubiquity of its underage viewers, YouTube denied its need to comply with COPPA.<sup>47</sup> The settlement also required YouTube—and Google as its parent company—to develop, implement, and maintain a system that allows channel owners to notify YouTube of any child-directed content on their channels.<sup>48</sup> Though Facebook<sup>49</sup> and Google<sup>50</sup> are the most notorious violators of privacy laws, the FTC has also settled other allegations of privacy and data violations with Cambridge Analytica,<sup>51</sup>Twitter,<sup>52</sup> Snapchat,<sup>53</sup> HyperBeard,<sup>54</sup> Unixiz, Inc.,<sup>55</sup> and RetinaX Studios.<sup>56</sup>

#### 3. TikTok
[14] TikTok captures the majority of today’s privacy-concerned headlines.<sup>57</sup> TikTok is a social media application that allows users to create and share short videos, often with whimsical dance moves choreographed to popular songs.<sup>58</sup> After launching in 2016, TikTok has accumulated more than 2.2 billion users worldwide and is valued at over $100 billion.<sup>59</sup> TikTok’s predecessor, Musical.ly, already settled with the FTC regarding previous COPPA violations.<sup>60</sup> ByteDance, Ltd., TikTok’s parent company, paid $5.7 million to settle the allegations with the FTC.<sup>61</sup> In recent months, U.S. officials have been concerned that TikTok will be obligated to relinquish user data to the Chinese government.<sup>62</sup> TikTok collects a plethora of user information including; a user’s location, internet address, copied clipboard text,<sup>63</sup> browsing history, messages, and contacts.<sup>64</sup> Most recently, a Wall Street Journal analysis found that TikTok collected unique identifiers—“media access control” (MAC) addresses—from millions of users, which allowed the application to track these users online without the user’s ability to opt out.<sup>65</sup> As a result of this additional scrutiny, ByteDance, Ltd., is considering changing its corporate structure or establishing a headquarters outside of China.<sup>66</sup>

[15] Children, tweens, and teenagers commonly use TikTok.<sup>67</sup> Unfortunately, this has made children increasingly vulnerable to sexual predators.<sup>68</sup> U.S. Senators have urged the FTC to further investigate TikTok for violating its 2019 settlement by retaining children’s data.<sup>69</sup> Parental complaints have also prompted the FTC to reopen its investigation, alleging that TikTok was aware that children under the age of 13 were signing up for, and using, the application without parental approval and oversight<sup>70</sup> (despite TikTok limiting its platform to people 13 years of age or older).<sup>71</sup> As data collection escalates, privacy rights should not become the norm. Now is the time to reclaim the right to privacy by preventing companies from monetizing children’s online data.
