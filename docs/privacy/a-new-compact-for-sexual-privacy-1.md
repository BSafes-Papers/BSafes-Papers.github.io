*A New Compact for Sexual Privacy*

## Introduction

1. TOC
{:toc}

Intimate life is under constant surveillance. Apps memorialize people’s menstruation cycles, fertility, and sexually transmitted infections.<sup>1</sup> Advertisers and analytics firms track searches and browsing on porn sites. Sex toys monitor the frequency and intensity of their owners’ use.<sup>2</sup> Digital assistants record, transcribe, and store conversations in bedrooms and bathrooms.<sup>3</sup>

In some contexts, people enter into relationships with the firms tracking their intimate lives.<sup>4</sup> This is true when individuals subscribe to dating apps or purchase digital assistants. In other contexts, people have no connection with the firms handling their intimate data. Data brokers, cyber stalking apps, and sites devoted to nonconsensual pornography and deep fake sex videos come to mind.<sup>5</sup>

<sup>4</sup> For instance, people subscribe to dating apps that record their sexual preferences and favorite positions, interest in threesomes, HIV status, and hookups. They use online services that facilitate testing for sexually transmitted infections and share the results with prospective partners. Kimberly Aquilina, STD testing?

Whether anticipated and desired or unknown and unwanted by individuals, the tracking of intimate information is poised for explosive growth. Profits drive what I have previously described as the “data collection imperative.”<sup>6</sup> For instance, analysts predict that within five years, the “femtech market”—menstruation, fertility, and sexual wellness apps— will be a $50 billion industry.<sup>7</sup>

The coin of the realm for digital services is personal data.<sup>8</sup> At some level, people understand that online services are not actually free.<sup>9</sup> But the firms intentionally structure the deal in a manner that obscures its lopsided nature. Individual consumers cannot fully grasp the potential risks, and few options exist for those who do (well, beyond not using the service). Firms have every incentive to reinforce the status quo from which they earn considerable profits.<sup>10</sup>

The surveillance of intimate life garners significant returns with little risk for businesses.<sup>11</sup> The opposite is true for individuals.<sup>12</sup> The private sector’s collection, use, storage, and disclosure of intimate information undermines what I have elsewhere called sexual privacy—the ways people manage the boundaries around intimate life.<sup>13</sup> Sexual privacy concerns the body, particularly the parts of the body associated with sex, gender, sexuality, and reproduction. It concerns any and all information about people’s sex, gender, sexuality, and sexual and reproductive health. This includes on- and offline activities, interactions, communications, thoughts, searches. It concerns the decisions that people make about their intimate lives. This Article tackles the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of information implicating sexual privacy, a crucial subset of sexual privacy that I will refer to as intimate information or intimate data.<sup>14</sup>

Sexual privacy is foundational for our personhood and essential for our ability to flourish as human beings.<sup>15</sup> It enables sexual and gender experimentation and identity development.<sup>16</sup> It frees us to express ourselves and to form intimate relationships and associations.<sup>17</sup> It secures human dignity and equal opportunity.<sup>18</sup>

Private-sector surveillance of intimate information strips individuals of their ability to decide who learns about their miscarriages, breakups, HIV infections, sexual assaults, and nude images. It undermines people’s selfesteem as they see themselves as intimate parts and not as whole selves. When companies categorize and rank people as rape sufferers or escort users and nothing more, they give those individuals fractured identities. People’s self-expression is chilled. Fearful of unwanted surveillance, people stop using dating apps, fertility trackers, or digital assistants. They refrain from browsing sites devoted to gender experimentation, sexuality, and reproductive health.

The harm can be profound. Intimate data reveals people’s physical and emotional vulnerabilities, which firms exploit to their advantage.<sup>19</sup> When intimate data is leaked or disclosed to hackers and criminals, individuals face reputational ruin, blackmail, and extortion.<sup>20</sup> When commercial hiring
