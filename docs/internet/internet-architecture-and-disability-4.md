## III. A LAYER-CONSCIOUS APPROACH TO INTERNET ACCESSIBILITY

The primary instrumental objective of applying disability law in any context is to address discrimination against people with disabilities by way of accessibility mandates—and the details of those mandates are critical. As Alex Geisinger and Michael Stein have described, the “ambit of protection” of disability law depends on the extent to which the “attendant [regulatory scheme] details precisely what . . . must be altered and how.”<sup>121</sup> With the previous Part’s insights into questions of perspective in mind, I turn in this Part to augmenting the internal, place- and website-centric perspective of Internet accessibility with an external, layer-conscious view that contemplates what is necessary to ensure accessibility at and across each of the constituent layers of the Internet. This approach is consonant with the approach of Robin Malloy who, borrowing from the Internet-law concept of “network goods,” has argued for approaching inclusive design in the context of land use planning with an understanding of the network goods, services, businesses, housing, neighborhoods, and civil and cultural activities of cities.<sup>122</sup>

Scholars have observed, however, that scholars and courts spent much of the first two decades of the ADA’s existence debating the scope of *disabilities* covered under the ADA, and the subsequent enactment of the ADA Amendments Act, which expanded the range of people who are protected by the ADA. BLANCK, *supra* note 5; Mark C. Weber, *Unreasonable Accommodation and Due Hardship*, 62 FLA. L. REV. 1119, 1122 (2010). The appropriate scope of disability coverage is beyond the scope of this Article, though the broad view of Internet accessibility discussed in this Article naturally implies support for accessibility requirements across at least the full range of disabilities covered by the ADA and ADAAA.

As the foregoing sections of this Article imply, Geisinger and Stein’s question of“what”—i.e., the relevant scope of Internet-enabled technology that is or must be covered by disability law—predominates this layer-conscious analysis. As this Part notes throughout, questions of the ultimate scope of Title III arise and must also be augmented by consideration of the role of other titles of the ADA, other disability laws, and other consumer protection laws,<sup>123</sup> particularly the provisions of telecommunications law administered by the Federal Communications Commission.

Geisinger and Stein’s question of “how”—the technical details of the changes that accessibility requires, from screen reader compatibility to closed captions to audio description to intermediated relay services to plain-language versions of content— also enters the discussion to some degree,<sup>124</sup> though their technical complexity leaves a complete exploration beyond the scope of this Article. While the Title III cases discussed above are primarily focused on the basic issue of screen reader compatibility with websites, what is required to make the whole Internet accessible to people with a range of disabilities raises a broader set of questions about how to address the accessibility of the wide variety of content, applications, networks, and devices that comprise the Internet. Each of these details—and their causal relationship with enabling people with disabilities to use the corresponding “place of public accommodation,” or not—fit neatly in what technology law scholars call“affordances” and “disaffordances” (i.e., how the relationship between a technology and its user facilitates or inhibits particular actions or behaviors by the user).<sup>125</sup>

Most importantly, though, this Part adds to the usual questions of “what” and“how” a significant focus the question of “who”—i.e., which people or entities bear the responsibility for accessibility mandates. While disability scholars and advocates often discuss accessibility in terms of a *right* for people with disabilities, to whom the corresponding *duty* belongs is a critical question.<sup>126</sup> While the answer is often the easily identified corporate proprietor of a website in Title III cases, the layered nature of the Internet means that the internal perspective of using an application or experiencing content may obscure that there are multiple actors involved in its provision. Because the question of who bears responsibility for accessibility— whether from a legal, normative, or architectural perspective—is perhaps the most sweeping addition to the usual set of disability law questions, this Part considers the Internet’s layers in terms of the categorical actors most likely to be responsible for, and thus able to effectuate accessibility at, each layer of the stack.<sup>127</sup>

Accordingly, this Part aims to disentangle the application and content layers, which are often conflated in Title III scholarship and litigation, by first exploring the distinction between individual websites and the broader World Wide Web. It then turns to the underappreciated role of web hosting *applications* in making website *content* accessible. Moving beyond the web, it turns to the set of dominant platforms that intermediate the provision of content in a variety of applications beyond the web.This Part closes with a  discussion of accessibility considerations specific to Internet service providers at the network and physical layers and devices that comprise the so-called Internet of Things.

### *A. Disentangling Content and Application: Website vs. Web Accessibility*

Superficially, Title III website cases are relatively simple matters of imposing straightforward regulations on easy-to-identify entities operating discrete, selfcontained applications. Most cases that successfully overcome Title III’s websitesas-places barrier require the sole proprietor of a self-contained website, such as a restaurant chain providing menu information<sup>128</sup> or the ability to place delivery orders online,<sup>129</sup> an online retail store selling goods,<sup>130</sup> or a brick-and-mortar retail store providing a complementary website for its in-store services,<sup>131</sup> to remediate a website’s structure to be compatible with screen reader software for users who are blind or visually impaired.<sup>132</sup> The *what, who*, and *how* seem on first blush to be relatively simple for these websites—Title III compels their proprietors to make them accessible to blind people.

But even for sole-proprietor websites, the questions of *who* and *how* are more complex, viewed from an external perspective, than they might initially appear from an internal perspective of the user’s experience. While individual websites can be conceptualized as discrete *applications*, they can also be conceptualized collectively as the constituent *content of the World Wide Web as an application.* <sup>133</sup> While the web is decentralized in the sense that there is no single proprietor of every website, the web is centralized in the sense that websites use a common set of technologies, specified in standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other standards-setting organizations. These standards include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which enable the design of the universal web browsers we use to view websites without the need for specialized software specific to individual websites.<sup>134</sup>

The accessibility of individual websites, then, is dependent not only on the architecture implemented by their proprietors, but on the centralized development of standards that facilitate accessibility. The W3C has developed voluntary guidelines for web accessibility, called the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which generally specify how websites can be developed in a way that is accessible to people with disabilities.<sup>135</sup> The WCAG standards<sup>136</sup> require that websites be:

 1. *Perceivable* by users with disabilities<sup>137</sup>—for example, by providing text alternatives for images for users who are blind or visually impaired<sup>138</sup> or avoiding the use of color contrasts that cannot be viewed by users who are colorblind;<sup>139</sup>
 
 1. *Operable* by users with disabilities<sup>140</sup>—for example, by structuring the site to allow navigation with a keyboard so that users who are blind or visually impaired need not use a graphical input mechanism like a mouse<sup>141</sup> and avoiding the use of flashing graphics that might cause seizures for users with epilepsy;<sup>142</sup>

***

The standards are divided into three levels of “conformance”—A, AA, and AAA— which include increasingly rigorous requirements.<sup>146</sup>

At the outset, WCAG’s governance raises an important disconnect: while the duty of website accessibility under U.S. law at least arguably falls on the proprietors of websites (*qua* places under Title III), the meaning of accessibility across the entire web is primarily set, if at all, by an international standards-setting organization that is not subject to Title III. That is, the accessibility obligations of websites at the content layer are dependent on standards independently developed for the web at the *application* layer by an entity, the W3C, which is never a party to Title III website accessibility litigation.<sup>147</sup>

The role of the WCAG standards has raised nontrivial concerns about *what* exactly is required to make a website legally accessible. For example, the Central District of Florida in Robles recently dismissed a complaint against Domino’s Pizza on due process grounds because of the lack of clarity on what standards would suffice for web accessibility<sup>148</sup>—though the holding was reversed<sup>149</sup> and other courts have reached the opposite conclusion.<sup>150</sup> The Robles district court cited the lack of resolution in the DOJ’s now-withdrawn rulemaking for website standards,<sup>151</sup> which specifically raised (but did not resolve) the question of whether and which level of WCAG standards should be formally incorporated into the DOJ’s Title III regulations for websites.<sup>152</sup> While advocates have cheered the reversal of Robles, the lack of clarity about the extent of WCAG’s applicability has hindered the viability and longevity of other Title III victories when questions arise about the standard of conduct that Title III imposes on websites—highly technical questions which generalist federal court judges seem poorly equipped to answer.<sup>153</sup>

Even if WCAG is ultimately able to be incorporated into DOJ’s rules and administered by federal courts, questions remain about its suitability. Peter Blanck has criticized reliance on WCAG and other standards alone as insufficient to serve the underlying goal of web “equality” for all people with disabilities, noting in particular that the approach of evaluating website compliance with WCAG standards emphasizes *accessibility* of website content for people with sensory disabilities at the expense of website *usability* for people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities.<sup>154</sup> And WCAG has substantive accessibility shortcomings in the area of *media* accessibility; for example, its standards for the quality of closed captions are substantially less detailed than those of the FCC’s detailed regulations for closed captions on television programming.<sup>155</sup>

While a full grappling with the governance and substantive advantages and disadvantages of WCAG is beyond the scope of this Article, it suffices to note that in terms of allocating responsibility, focusing Title III and its attendant legal institutions, including the federal courts and the DOJ in a rulemaking and settlement capacity, on the *content* layer of the web may leave significant shortcomings in the contours of the accessibility of the web as an *application*. At most, Title III has supported the importation of WCAG into the ADA—but neither the courts nor DOJ have demonstrated a significant ability to interrogate the suitability of WCAG in serving Title III’s goals, to alter and augment the content of WCAG to serve the goal of website accessibility, or to provide sophisticated and muscular enforcement of its terms.<sup>156</sup> However well a place-centric approach to Title III can establish that websites must be accessible, the external perspective of websites as content and the web as an application raises questions about the ability for that approach to address the substance of accessibility requirements at the application layer.

### *B. Allocating Responsibility on a Platform-Based Web*
Setting aside the desire for robust and consistent substantive requirements for accessibility across the web as an application, the internal perspective fostered by Title III’s place centricity maintains a temptation to insist on holding individual websites wholly accountable for their accessibility failures. In terms of antidiscrimination theory, that website proprietors may be ignorant about what must be done to make their websites accessible is no less an economically driven choice— and a morally repugnant one—than a choice to knowingly and deliberately exclude people with disabilities from websites.<sup>157</sup>

But the layered architecture of the Internet—and the corresponding involvement of multiple entities in sculpting the user experience—will continue to raise questions about how, as a practical matter, to allocate responsibility and liability among these entities, even if the user is not actively aware that some of them exist and are playing a key role in intermediating the user’s experience.<sup>158</sup> These questions are underscored by the reality that the majority of websites are not built from scratch by their proprietors, but instead by customizing elaborate commercial and open-source content management platforms like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Squarespace, and Shopify that abstract much of the underlying architecture to allow nontechnical proprietors to develop the content with limited or no knowledge of the code that is generated.<sup>159</sup> If the web can be said to have any centralized points of operational responsibility at the application layer, they are the platforms that serve the majority of the world’s websites.

While some accessibility issues with websites hosted by these platforms are dependent on the code and content developed by their proprietors, such as adding alternate text tags to images for use by blind users or captions and other nonaural substitutes to audio content for users who are deaf or hard of hearing, many accessibility issues are rooted in the structure of the platforms themselves, the templates they provide users, and the tools they provide to author website content. The importance of authoring tools is so significant that W3C has developed a separate set of Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) aimed at platforms and other authoring tools.<sup>160</sup> ATAG requires platforms to support the production of accessible content by:<sup>161</sup>

 1. Providing authors with behavioral nudges and facilities to make the content of their websites accessible from the outset<sup>162</sup> and remediate accessibility problems on existing websites.<sup>163</sup>
 
 1. Making website templates and reusable content, such as stock photos, accessible by default.<sup>164</sup> 
 
 1. Ensuring that automatic authoring processes spit out accessible website code and preserve accessibility information, such as alternate text for images.<sup>165</sup>

 1. Making authoring tools accessible by authors with disabilities<sup>166</sup>—a key step in related efforts to stop the proliferation of the false dichotomy between authors and people with disabilities.<sup>167</sup>
 
 1. Promote the availability of accessibility features.<sup>168</sup>

Despite the development of ATAG, accessibility issues with website hosting platforms remain significant. For example, in 2018, the lead accessibility designer of WordPress, which hosts *more than a third* of the world’s ten million most popular ,<sup>169</sup> publicly resigned in protest because there were “*so many accessibility issues*” in Gutenberg, a newly developed version of WordPress’s website editor, that“most testers [examining accessibility and usability issues] refused to look at [it] again.”<sup>170</sup> And other leading platforms include in their support documents explicit disclaimers of compliance with website accessibility laws like Title III<sup>171</sup>— effectively seeking to leverage contract law to shift the responsibility for accessibility, at least in a legal sense, to the proprietors of websites that use the platforms.

Though the accessibility on a majority of the world’s most popular websites is dependent in significant part on accessibility support of just half a dozen or fewer web hosting platforms, no significant litigation or settlement agreements have yet addressed website platforms. This is the case even though Title III litigation has undoubtedly targeted websites hosted on these platforms, rooted in problems caused by the platforms rather than the platform user/website proprietor.<sup>172</sup>

The lack of lawsuits against website hosting platforms likely is a dual function of Title III’s doctrinal focus on places and the associated internal perspective on the user experience that focus demands. That is, it is unclear to an ordinary user that a website’s inaccessibility stems from failures in the codebase of an underlying platform—a platform whose very existence may be unknown to the user. It may well be that Title III will be able to target website platforms as a doctrinal matter, but doing so will require a conception of Title III that goes beyond “places” and addresses the accessibility dimensions of the Internet’s infrastructure. <sup>173</sup>

### *C. Application Accessibility Beyond the Web*
Allocating responsibility among website proprietors and hosting platforms previews the broader challenge of addressing responsibility for accessibility across the diversity of non-web Internet applications. Since even the early days of the commercial Internet when the web dominated Internet use, the Internet has supported a significant quantity of non-web applications.<sup>174</sup> Today, the most popular of these applications include video streaming, gaming, social media, shopping, file sharing, and instant messaging,<sup>175</sup> the provision of which has come to be dominated by large“platform” companies such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Netflix, and Amazon.<sup>176</sup>

But Internet law scholars have explored in much more significant depth the definitions of the terms “platform,”“intermediary,” and related terms. E.g., Julie E. Cohen, *Law for the Platform Economy*, 51 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. 133, 143 (2017) (describing platforms as “represent[ing] infrastructurebased strategies for introducing friction into networks”); Tarleton Gillespie, *Platforms Are Not Intermediaries*, 2 GEO.

AFFAIRS 3, 8 (2018) (characterizing the “largest, most successful firms” as “platforms [that] ran[k] and rat[e] other entities rather than directly providing goods and services”); Philip J. Weiser, *Law and Information Platforms*, 1 J. ON TELECOMM. & HIGH TECH. L. 1, 3–4 (2002) (defining“information platforms” in terms of “network standards around which complementary products must be developed”); *see also* Ben Thompson, *Defining Aggregators*, STRATECHERY (Sept. 26, 2017), https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/ [https://perma.cc/4YPG-27PD] (defining “aggregators” as “hav[ing] a direct relationship with users,” incurring zero marginal costs in serving users, and having by “[d]emand-driven [m]ulti-sided [n]etworks with [d]ecreasing [a]cquisition [c]osts”).

For accessibility purposes, a critical distinction between the web and these other applications is that the user interacts with the *platform* as an application, which in turn intermediates access to the platform’s *content.* That is, a user accessing a restaurant’s website may have no idea that the website is hosted on WordPress or Squarespace, and a user watching a video on Netflix or YouTube might not know the identity of the entity or person responsible for creating the video. And even where a user knows the identity of the person responsible for creating content—for example, the person posting personal photos to a social media platform such as Facebook or Instagram—accessibility problems are likely to pervade classes of media across millions or billions of users on a platform. From an internal perspective, then, the logical target of a Title III lawsuit might likely be the platform operating the application rather than the entity or person responsible for creating the content.

Of course, a threshold issue for holding these platforms directly accountable for accessibility is whether they can be subject to Title III in the first instance. The limited litigation targeting platforms under Title III has led to mixed results, with some courts dismissing cases on the predictable grounds that platforms do not constitute physical places.<sup>177</sup> Even cases where courts have extended Title III liability to platform operators have focused on the portions of those applications accessible via their operators’ *websites*, <sup>178</sup> and it remains unclear whether Title III will be sufficiently flexible to extend to the components of platform applications provided via native smartphone, tablet, and television/set-top box applications not so easily amenable to Title III’s place metaphor.<sup>179</sup> It is unclear the extent to which other applications, such as video games, will fit within Title III<sup>180</sup> or regulations promulgated by the FCC.<sup>181</sup>

Questions of substance also abound. Just as legal requirements for making a website accessible to a user who is blind or visually impaired have been hashed out in significant depth,<sup>182</sup> the FCC has grappled with the contours of making video programming<sup>183</sup> and communications applications<sup>184</sup> accessible to people with different disabilities. Moreover, as Peter Blanck has suggested, making the broad array of Internet applications accessible to people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities is substantially underexplored and remains a significant academic challenge in the area of Human-Computer Interface (HCI) design.<sup>185</sup> Whether particular accessibility requirements ultimately will be sustained is not a given, either; the ADA’s fundamental alteration doctrine, which excludes from accessibility mandates requirements that would “fundamentally alter” the nature of the covered public accommodation, raises questions about what accessibility efforts might in fact be required by Title III.<sup>186</sup>

But setting aside these threshold questions of *what and how* leaves the perhaps more significant question of *who*<sup>187</sup>—that is, how should disability law allocate responsibility between platform companies and the entities responsible for creating content hosted by the platforms across a diverse array of arrangements?<sup>188</sup> Platforms such as Netflix, which purchases the rights to movies, television shows, and other video programming via sophisticated commercial transactions, pose a different set of challenges than platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, eBay, Craigslist, and Wikipedia, which allow any user to submit content for intermediation at no direct cost.

Even platforms that exercise a high degree of control over the content they distribute raise non-trivial questions of responsibility for accessibility. By way of example, Netflix is subject to extensive closed captioning requirements to provide equal access to people who are deaf or hard of hearing under a number of legal regimes. First, the FCC’s apparatus regulations require Netflix’s website and applications to support the display of closed captions provided with video programming on its website and mobile and set-top box applications.<sup>189</sup> Second, the FCC’s IP closed captioning regulations require Netflix to provide *closed captions themselves* for any television programming with captions,<sup>190</sup> which are required by the FCC for most television programming.<sup>191</sup> And even Netflix’s original programming that has never been shown on television is subject to captioning obligations under a 2012 settlement agreement of Title III litigation with the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) that requires Netflix to caption all its content.<sup>192</sup>

Notwithstanding the array of closed captioning requirements facing Netflix, problems still arise with closed captions, including most recently a social media firestorm over the censorship in captions of curse words that were not bleeped out from the audio track in Netflix’s reboot of the series *Queer Eye for the Straight Guy*. <sup>193</sup> This is because Netflix, in many cases,  does not create the closed captions for its programming, but relies on the providers of the video programming it distributes to provide closed captions.<sup>194</sup> Netflix publicly describes an antagonistic relationship with these providers and threatens rejection of videos submitted with inferior or problematic closed captions.<sup>195</sup>

Addressing the allocation of responsibility among even sophisticated commercial providers and distributors of video programming is not a new issue for disability law outside the realm of Title III. For example, the FCC has struggled for more than two decades to apportion responsibility for the provision and quality of captions between the providers and distributors of video programming. The FCC’s initial rules adopted in the late 1990s placed all responsibility for captioning on video distributors on the thinking that distributors would leverage their contractual relationships to force video providers to include high-quality closed captions.<sup>196</sup> But in 2016, the FCC reassigned responsibility for some parts of its captioning regulations to the providers of video programming, concluding that relying on contractual relationships had been ineffective and frequently resulted in missing or poor-quality captions that were primarily the fault of video programming providers.<sup>197</sup>

The sheer scale, economic configuration, and legal status of the largest Internet platforms, which are constructed to facilitate ordinary people sharing content at little or no cost, are almost certain to exacerbate these challenges for allocating responsibility. For example, Facebook, the leading social media platform, is used by more than two billion people each month,<sup>198</sup> who collectively post almost two billion images to Facebook each day.<sup>199</sup> More than a billion auctions are hosted on eBay at a given moment,<sup>200</sup> and more than eighty million ads a month are posted to Craigslist.<sup>201</sup> Users of YouTube, the leading video platform, now upload more than four hundred hours of video *every minute*. <sup>202</sup> Wikipedia’s volunteer editors have posted more than 5.9 million articles, including multiple terabytes of images, video, and other media.<sup>203</sup>

As a result, disability law must grapple with how to allocate responsibility for accessibility between platforms and their users. The aforementioned principles of layer integrity and layer crossing minimization suggest targeting regulations at the layer of the stack where problems occur.<sup>204</sup> These principles suggest that, at a minimum, disability law should intervene at the application layer to require platforms to make their interfaces accessible and to require the provision of authoring tools to enable users to make their content accessible.

Some of these problems are solved in principle by the FCC’s video player regulations,<sup>205</sup> which require televisions, computers, laptops, set-top boxes, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to display closed captions<sup>206</sup> and play back audio description and accessible emergency information<sup>207</sup> Others are similarly addressed by the FCC’s advanced communications service (ACS) regulations,<sup>208</sup> which require Voice over IP (VoIP), text messaging, and video conferencing<sup>209</sup> services<sup>210</sup> and equipment<sup>211</sup> to be accessible.<sup>212</sup> Others might be solved by interpreting the ADA to apply WCAG or similar standards to the interfaces of the applications and Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) or similar standards to the authoring and hosting mechanisms provided by platforms.<sup>213</sup>

But what, then, about the accessibility of content itself—for example,  theprovision of closed captions and audio descriptions for video, alternate text tags for images, transcripts for audio files such as podcasts, and plain-language versions of textual articles? Layer integrity and crossing minimization would suggest that these are problems that manifest at the content layer, and thus should be solved there by requiring platform users to make their content accessible to people with disabilities.

This insight is also supported by the prospect that platforms will invoke Section 230 of the Communications Act, which exempts platforms from being treated as the publisher or speaker of content they host for the purpose of defamation and other laws,<sup>214</sup> as a defense against Title III claims that would make them responsible for the accessibility of content posted by their users, although Congress and Internet-law scholars have increasingly begun to debate the extent to which Section 230 should serve as a shield for platforms facilitating discrimination through the hosting of content.<sup>215</sup> The Department of Justice has also unhelpfully set regulations that excuse public accommodations from “alter[ing] [their] inventory to include accessible or special goods,” including “Brailled versions of books, books on audio cassettes, [or] closed-captioned video tapes,”<sup>216</sup> though courts have alternatively accepted and rejected the application of this regulation in the context of technology accessibility cases.<sup>217</sup>

However, Title III contains a barrier to mandating accessibility at the content layer itself. The undue burden limitation relieves places of public accommodation from accessibility mandates where compliance would result in an undue economic burden.<sup>218</sup> Parallel to the fundamental alteration doctrine, undue burden is rooted in the notion that disability law should not achieve equal access to a public accommodation by forcing it out of existence and therefore leaving people with and without disabilities equally unable to access it.<sup>219</sup>

Undue burden features prominently in content accessibility primarily because adding accessibility features to content, including closed captions, video descriptions, text tags, and transcripts, can be nontrivially expensive relative to the cost of using a platform, access to which is often provided at no cost.<sup>220</sup> While some platform users are sophisticated commercial entities who can easily afford to make their content accessible—and in some cases are required to do so under FCC regulations<sup>221</sup>—many are ordinary people uploading pictures and videos of pets and children, selling household items, and writing articles and posting media about areas of personal interest—all relatively frictionless and effectively transactions on modern platforms. Though the issue has not been litigated in the context of Title III, some platform users may argue that the imposition of a requirement that they caption or describe a personal video at some cost, which they would otherwise upload at no cost, would impose an undue burden.<sup>222</sup>

The question returns, then, to whether platforms might be compelled to make the content they host accessible. The question of undue burden aside,<sup>223</sup> automation may provide a solution.<sup>224</sup> Platforms and academic researchers are developing advanced algorithms to automatically generate captions for videos,<sup>225</sup> alternate text descriptions for pictures,<sup>226</sup> and even preliminary audio descriptions for video<sup>227</sup> and dynamically generated plain-language versions of websites accessible to people with intellectual and cognitive disabilities,<sup>228</sup> though significant quality problems persist with many of these techniques.<sup>229</sup> Relatedly, significant advances in recognizing both statutory exceptions and limitations in copyright law<sup>230</sup> and recognition by the courts<sup>231</sup> and the U.S. Copyright Office<sup>232</sup> of wide latitude to make copyrighted works accessible consistent with the doctrine of fair use have helped remove copyright barriers to third-party accessibility efforts,<sup>233</sup> though questions remain about the extent to which third parties might be held responsible under the ADA or other disability laws for the creation of poor-quality remediation.<sup>234</sup>

<sup>223</sup>. On the flip side, the dynamic of at-scale accessibility raises the prospects of positive externalities, such as the use of closed captions for search engine optimization and ad targeting. While the familiar examples of closed captions in loud bars and quiet hospitals are widely known, the battle to capture the value of positive externalities of accessibility features is often contentious. *See, e.g.*, Fox News Network, LLC v. TVEyes, Inc., 883 F.3d 169, 173– 74, 181 (2d Cir. 2018) (concluding that a media-monitoring service that indexed and enabled search of television clips at scale using closed-captioned text copied from broadcasts constituted copyright infringement).

While it is unclear how advances in automatic content accessibility technology ultimately will evolve to address this problem, it is worth considering economic interventions to incentivize the development of tools and services that will enable making large quantities of content accessible. One example is found in *Title IV* of the ADA, whose provisions are codified in the telecommunications section of the U.S. Code.<sup>235</sup> Title IV subsidizes third parties who provide relay services, which generally involve situating a human or automated communications assistant in the middle of a phone call to interpret between a nondisabled phone caller and another caller using sign language via video, provide captions, type out text communications, or one of several other variants.<sup>236</sup> Most importantly, the costs of providing the services are recovered from users of telephone services via their phone carriers and administered by the FCC.<sup>237</sup>

The important insight from Title IV is that it facilitates the accessibility of an application—voice communication—by subsidizing the creation of accessible content (signed, captioned, and other adapted versions of one caller’s voice) that neither the content creator (the nondisabled caller) nor the application provider (the phone company) could ostensibly afford. It does so by requiring application providers to bake into the price of their service the cost of making it accessible, thereby spreading the cost among all users of an application. It also vests the FCC with the authority to structure the administration of the program to incentivize innovation that improves quality and drives costs down.<sup>238</sup>

It is not clear whether such a model, or similar models such as the direct government funding of captioning<sup>239</sup> or remediation of inaccessible books,<sup>240</sup> would be workable for today’s dominant Internet platforms, many of which provide services at no direct cost to users and instead derive revenue through the provision of advertisements targeted using the data of their users.<sup>241</sup> But these sorts of economic tweaks are one area of promise for unraveling the Gordian knot of allocating responsibility between the application and content layers of today’s platformdominated Internet ecosystem.

### *D. ISPs: Internet Access and Accessibility at the Physical and Network Layers*

Disentangling the application and content layers of the Internet makes clear the need to consider the role of entities at all the layers of the Internet. And a user cannot access any application or content without connecting to the Internet via an Internet service provider (ISP).<sup>242</sup> ISPs intermediate access to all Internet-enabled applications through their control over the implementation of protocols at the network layer and their provision at the physical layer of the wired and wireless infrastructure that facilitates the literal connection of users to the Internet.

This Section explores the *accessibility* dimensions of ISPs’ gatekeeping role over *access* to the Internet. Recalling the admittedly imperfect metaphor of the Internet as the “information superhighway,”<sup>243</sup> it is worth briefly conceptualizing the physical and network layers as the roads and sidewalks of cyberspace—the connective tissue between places of public accommodation. In the real world, this issue is often the province of federal, state, and local governments that are governed not by Title III, but by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1976, which requires federal programs to be accessible,<sup>244</sup> by Title II of the ADA, which requires the same for state and local government programs and services,<sup>245</sup>and by other federal laws.<sup>246</sup> But the provision of Internet access service is largely the province of private companies that, except in scenarios involving state or municipally provided broadband, are not subject to Title II. Instead, the accessibility dimensions of ISPs are generally governed by telecommunications law.<sup>247</sup>

Past is prologue in Internet policy, and telecommunications law’s treatment of the accessibility of networks long predates the Internet. Of course, many telecommunications networks—including radio, broadcast television, and cable and satellite television—have served as single-“application” mechanisms, in Internet-law terms, for the one-way distribution of content to people. And as the previous Section explained, the accessibility of those networks has primarily been facilitated by FCC regulations focused on remediating content—generally through the provision of captioning to make audiovisual and audio programming accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing and the provision of audio description to make video programming accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired—and requiring video playback devices to render accessibility features.<sup>248</sup>

But even within these integrated-networks-as-video-applications, issues of *network protocol* have played an important role in facilitating accessibility for people with disabilities. For example, television networks have long opposed the inclusion of open captions—captions “burned in” and enabled for all viewers, which cannot be turned off—on the grounds that hearing viewers would find them distracting.<sup>249</sup> As a result, accessibility advocates and technologists facilitated the development of closed captions—which could be turned on or off by individual viewers—by developing standards for steganographically encoding captions into the invisible twenty-first scan line (“Line 21”) of broadcast signals, which is transmitted but not displayed on most TVs, thereby enabling the development of caption decoders to parse the invisible information and render it on-screen for viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing.<sup>250</sup>

Nowhere has the role of network protocol accessibility been more critically important than in the network that preceded and effectively enabled the development of the commercial Internet<sup>251</sup>—the telephone network. Of course, the telephone network, like one-way video distribution networks, was initially an integrated network designed to facilitate a single application—bidirectional voice communication.<sup>252</sup>

The accessibility problems introduced by bidirectional voice communications are obvious in hindsight: an application that relies on both speech and hearing, without more, was certain to exclude people with speech and hearing disabilities. Karen Peltz Strauss has noted the cruel irony of the discriminatory nature of the telephone network, which grew out of the text-based telegraph system that Alexander Graham Bell had created specifically to help his deaf students, wife, and mother.<sup>253</sup> It took deaf and hard of hearing advocates and technologists more than ninety years after Bell’s invention of the telephone network to begin the successful proliferation of the teletypewriter (TTY), which facilitates real-time, text-based communications by transmitting typed letters via audio tones over the phone line, that restored the access for deaf and hard of hearing people in the transition from the telegraph to the telephone.<sup>254</sup>

Though the full history of the accessibility of the telephone-network-as-voicecommunication-application is beyond the scope of this article,<sup>255</sup> it is worth emphasizing that even the introduction of TTYs required overcoming discrimination against people with disabilities by AT&T, the proprietor of the phone network. Unlike the omissive failures described above,<sup>256</sup> the discrimination against TTY users was overt—AT&T leveraged its dominant control over the phone system to deny its customers the ability to attach third-party devices, including TTYs, to the telephone network as illegal “foreign attachments.”<sup>257</sup>

A critical step in making the phone network accessible was the FCC’s *Carterfone* order, which concluded that excluding third-party devices from the network was a violation of the prohibition on “unreasonable discrimination” in the Communications Act of 1934.<sup>258</sup> These important but underexplored antidiscrimination threads continued into the breakup of AT&T under antitrust law259 and were later addressed by Congress in the requirements of Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires telecommunications services and equipment to be made accessible to people with disabilities.<sup>260</sup> And as voice telephony transitioned to the Internet, the FCC extended Section 255 to VoIP applications.<sup>261</sup> Congress eventually gave the FCC extensive authority to regulate the accessibility of VoIP services under the advanced communications services provisions of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 (CVAA),<sup>262</sup> and the FCC has begun to facilitate the transition from TTY services to next-generation real-time text (RTT) services.<sup>263</sup>

The broader lesson from the evolution of the accessibility provisions governing telephony is that telecommunications law has long played an important role in overcoming discrimination against people with disabilities, since even before the introduction of the ADA. That is, telecommunications law rightfully should be considered a first-order *disability* law alongside the ADA, and its anti-discrimination provisions should be embraced and engaged by disability advocates and scholars.

The important role of telecommunications law as disability law is more important as the prominence of the telephone network has given way to the Internet. This is no surprise, as the telephone network has transitioned from effectively serving only as a voice application to one of the key technological bases of the commercial Internet. The telephone network facilitated the rise of the commercial Internet by affording Internet access via dial-up Internet services, which featured modems that modulated digital IP-based communications into analog audio tones, transmitted them over the phone line, and reconverted them to digital signals for transmission over the Internet.<sup>264</sup> It has continued to do so through the use of digital subscriber line (DSL) technology, which along with cable, satellite, cellular, and various other wired and wireless services, now connects hundreds of millions of Americans to the Internet.<sup>265</sup>

Early in the rise of the commercial Internet, Internet-law scholars recognized that discrimination was a critical threat to the future of the Internet. In 2003’s *Network* *Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination,* Tim Wu called for “a direct scrutiny of broadband discrimination,” famously coining the term “net neutrality”—the notion, broadly speaking, that ISPs should not be able to leverage their positions as gatekeepers of “terminating access monopolies” against their users to discriminate against users’ access to the applications and content of their choice.<sup>266</sup> Considerable scholarly, regulatory, and popular attention has been devoted to the *Network Neutrality* half of Wu’s title and its attendant implications for the economics and governance of—and innovation and free speech on—the Internet.<sup>267</sup>

However, some scholars have taken up the important but less explored focus of Wu’s work: *Broadband Discrimination*—that is, the potential for noneconomic *discrimination* by ISPs and the possibility of antidiscrimination remedies.<sup>268</sup> Olivier Sylvain has conceptualized ISP discrimination along lines of race, ethnicity, and income in terms similar to those of disability scholars arguing for Internet accessibility, noting that the Internet “is the premier communications platform through which public life today is shaped” and that “[t]o be excluded from all of its affordances is either an act of defiance, ignorance, or the consequence of material misfortune and disadvantage.”<sup>269</sup>

The potential for discrimination problems involving people with disabilities at the network and physical layers has come to bear in the context of debates over network neutrality. People with disabilities were unexpectedly thrust into the FCC’s approach to network neutrality in 2014 when Mother Jones reported that Verizon lobbyists were urging members of Congress to spike then-pending FCC net neutrality rules on the grounds that they would hurt people with disabilities.<sup>270</sup> The vague argument insinuated that it was necessary to single out the Internet traffic of people with disabilities, creating special “fast lanes” for accessible communications, to ensure their ability to use the Internet on equal terms.<sup>271</sup> In effect, Verizon had argued for addressing one type of discrimination—the alleged performance shortcomings of a neutral Internet for accessible applications—with another, isolating applications used by people with disabilities for special treatment.

Verizon made the claims, however, without first consulting consumer organizations representing people with disabilities; the National Association of the Deaf (NAD), the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), and the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) emphasized, on the record, that they had not been consulted.<sup>272</sup> A coalition of disability organizations and researchers— which, in the interest of full disclosure, I represented at the FCC—quickly scrambled to investigate Verizon’s claims.

The results of the coalition’s investigations, reported in filings to the FCC, revealed that the need for disability-specific treatment of applications was, at a minimum, considerably overstated, a conclusion noted in a widely shared article entitled *Deaf Advocacy Groups to Verizon: Don’t Kill Net Neutrality on Our Behalf*. <sup>273</sup> The coalition argued that making Internet-based applications accessible “is possible on an open network and without the need for broadband providers to specifically identify traffic from accessibility applications and separate it out for special treatment.”<sup>274</sup> The coalition noted that accessibility concerns could be addressed, along with similar concerns that would apply to broad classes of applications through the FCC’s allowance of non-discriminatory “reasonable network management” practices, and urged the Commission to reject using disability as a basis for allowing ISPs to discriminate among applications.<sup>275</sup>

The coalition argued not only that disability-specific fast lanes are unnecessary to achieve Internet accessibility, but also that affording ISPs the ability to discriminate could result in placing applications that people with disabilities relied upon in a slow lane—or blocking them altogether.<sup>276</sup> The coalition described how ISPs had blocked the use of video conferencing services, including Apple FaceTime and Google Hangouts, which are frequently relied upon by American Sign Language users to communicate with each other.<sup>277</sup> The coalition noted that ISP blocking and prioritization that hindered video communication by signers often occurred in places of employment and places of public accommodation, such as coffee shops and airports, arguably in violation of the ADA.<sup>278</sup> The coalition also noted the importance of nondiscrimination in the administration of Internet access plans, explaining that the data caps imposed on many plans, while sufficient for many users, hindered the ability for deaf and hard of hearing users to engage in basic communications over video while forcing them to pay extra for voice services that they could not use.<sup>279</sup>

In the landmark *2015 Open Internet Order*, the FCC ignored Verizon’s arguments and adopted bans on application-based blocking, throttling, and other rules,<sup>280</sup> as well as specific transparency requirements aimed at ensuring that people with disabilities could evaluate the suitability of broadband plans for use with accessible applications.<sup>281</sup> However, the rules were reopened following the election of Donald Trump and his appointment of Ajit Pai as the Chairman of the FCC. Chairman Pai, who dissented from the 2015 Order,<sup>282</sup> immediately opened a rulemaking aimed at abolishing the rules.<sup>283</sup>

Net neutrality opponents again raised the specter of disability-specific prioritization as a justification for abolishing the rules,<sup>284</sup> but cited as evidence only a decade-old (and failed) experiment by the Welsh government to provide video calling to citizens with disabilities over prioritized connections.<sup>285</sup> The coalition of disability advocates and researchers urged the FCC to maintain the antidiscrimination rules, noting that there was no serious evidence of a need for disability-specific prioritization<sup>286</sup> and that the rules had effectively curtailed the discriminatory blocking of applications, yielding a slew of new high-bandwidth video conferencing and personal navigation applications<sup>287</sup> needed by people with disabilities.<sup>288</sup> The coalition again raised alarm bells over the increasing use of data caps by ISPs, which hindered the increasing usage of high-bandwidth applications by people with disabilities<sup>289</sup> and emphasized the danger of ISPs building their own proprietary video conferencing and navigation systems, tying people with disabilities who relied on those applications to specific network providers and increasing the incentives for discrimination against competing applications.<sup>290</sup> The FCC ignored these concerns, rescinding the blocking and throttling rules later in the* 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom Order*.<sup>291</sup>

A full exploration of the implications of network deployment and operation policy at the physical and network layers for accessibility is beyond the scope of this article, and this article leaves unexplored, for example, important issues of broadband deployment to people with disabilities<sup>292</sup> and the impact of wireless spectrum policy on hearing aids.<sup>293</sup> But the net neutrality saga serves to underscore that Internet accessibility will require addressing issues of discrimination at the network and physical layers. Telecommunications law will continue to be an important complement to the ADA in the tangle of disability laws that must ultimately be applied to achieve Internet accessibility

#### *E. Accessible Devices and the Internet of Things*
Finally, making the constituent layers of the Internet accessible will not suffice to make the whole Internet accessible if the devices that people with disabilities use to connect to the Internet and interact with Internet-enabled applications are not themselves accessible. As James Grimmelmann and Paul Ohm have explained, the value of applying non-discrimination principles to the Internet itself can be significantly constrained by the failure to apply those same principles to the *devices that connect* to the Internet.<sup>294</sup>

The desire for accessible devices dates back to at least the early nineteenth century, when Pellegrino Turri invented a typing machine and carbon paper for Countess Carolina Fantoni da Fivizzano—his friend who was blind.<sup>295</sup> Thomas Edison likewise invented the phonograph for the express purpose of making books accessible in aural form to blind people.<sup>296</sup> But in the Internet age, the accessibility of personal devices is becoming increasingly important as the devices constituting the so-called “Internet of Things” (IoT)—i.e., devices that connect to the Internet— proliferate at an increasing scale. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has noted predictions that the number of Internet-connected devices in the United States will increase from 2.3 billion to 4.1 billion between 2015 and 2020, “portend[ing] significant and in some cases revolutionary changes[] [and] offer[ing] the potential for industry, government, and individuals to reap benefits interms of increased efficiency, safety, and  convenience that were previously impossible.”<sup>297</sup>

Though IoT devices have been described in terms of numerous and varying characteristics,<sup>298</sup> the most salient category for the purpose of this article is the devices that people use to interact with applications on the Internet, which range from desktop and laptop computers to phones and tablets to digital televisions to devices in clothing, cars, airplanes, and household appliances.<sup>299</sup> IoT devices enable a variety of input and output modalities, including speech and pressure-sensitive touchscreens and screen less devices that communicate with aural and/or tactile feedback.

These input and output modalities create significant potential for accessibility problems. For example, virtual assistant applications, including Amazon’s Echo, Google’s Assistant, and Apple’s Siri, are embedded into so-called “smart speaker” devices that listen for verbal instructions and questions and respond with aural feedback.300 While these devices can be a significant boon for people who are blind or visually impaired,<sup>301</sup> they can remain effectively inaccessible to people with hearing or speech disabilities who are unable to use the devices’ input and output modalities.<sup>302</sup>

Internet-law scholars have raised significant concerns about the potential for discrimination in IoT devices.<sup>303</sup> But few scholars have addressed the potential for IoT devices to yield discrimination against people with disabilities,<sup>304</sup> largely focusing instead on discrimination rooted in the widespread collection of personal data by IoT devices and the attendant privacy, security, and economic harms resulting from the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other technologies to exploit the data.<sup>305</sup> That is, scholars have largely focused on the extent to which IoT devices can indirectly result in discrimination, rather than the extent to which IoT devices can be *inherently* discriminatory by way of inaccessibility.<sup>306</sup>

Title III has been applied where devices bear a significant connection to a physical place of public accommodation, such as the accessibility of an ATM at a bank or other business, a computer at an Internet café, a registration kiosk at a hotel, or a point-of-sale device at a retail store.<sup>307</sup> Most recently, these types of cases have been brought against or contemplated in the context of so-called“sharing economy” companies such as Uber,<sup>308</sup> Bird, and Lime<sup>309</sup> that fail to make transportation services like cars and scooters accessible to people with disabilities.<sup>310</sup> Title III can also apply where a device is *itself contemplated as an means of accessibility* for an inaccessible place of public accommodation—in Title III’s terminology, an “auxiliary aid”—such as an assistive listening device, a closed caption decoder, a telephone handset amplifier, or a screen reader or magnification software used to make the services of a place of public accommodation accessible.<sup>311</sup>

But Title III has not been significantly or directly applied to the accessibility of personal devices purchased by consumers. Indeed, the Department of Justice has declared that “the ADA does not apply directly to the manufacture of products,” and that it “lacks the authority to issue design requirements for equipment designed exclusively for use in private homes.”<sup>312</sup> And what, precisely, might be required to make devices accessible raises significant technical questions about the nature of accessible product design.

Non-ADA legal regimes have, to some degree, compensated for Title III’s perceived inability to require device accessibility. Legal mandates for the accessibility of devices and software used for person-to-person communications date back to the pre-Internet Telecommunications for the Disabled Act of 1982, which mandated rudimentary accessibility for the telephone system, including compatibility between phones and hearing aids.<sup>313</sup> In the Internet era, Section 255 of the Communications Act<sup>314</sup> and the corresponding guidelines developed by the U.S.Access Board<sup>315</sup> and the FCC<sup>316</sup> directly mandated the accessibility of equipment used for telecommunications services, such as telephones, routers, switches, set-top boxes, and home networking equipment used to connect telephone and VoIP services.<sup>317</sup> Likewise, Sections 102 and 104 of the CVAA<sup>318</sup> and the corresponding regulations developed by the FCC extended Section 255 to new advanced communications services equipment used to facilitate electronic messaging, VoIP, and video conferencing services,<sup>319</sup> as well as to web browsers built into mobile phones.<sup>320</sup>

Likewise, non-ADA regimes have augmented Title III by requiring the accessibility of devices used to view video programming. These mandates date back to the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990 (TDCA), which required televisions thirteen inches or larger to include closed-captioning decoders.<sup>321</sup> The TDCA’s provisions, updated by Sections 203 and 204 of the CVAA<sup>322</sup> and elaborated upon in the FCC’s corresponding rules,<sup>323</sup> now require video playback devices of all sorts, including Internet-enabled video devices, to enable closed captions and video descriptions and to have accessible user interfaces.<sup>324</sup>

But the Section 255 guidelines, ACS rules, and video programming rules are not universally applicable and cover only limited classes of networking equipment, communications devices and software, certain web browsers, and video playback hardware and software, and do not fully cover a significant proportion of IoT devices with functionality that goes beyond these contours.<sup>325</sup> While the FCC contemplated extending its Section 255 and ACS rules further in its 2015 *Open Internet Order* by applying Section 255 to ostensibly all equipment connected to the Internet,<sup>326</sup> the 2017 *Restoring Internet Freedom Order* rescinded this broad application of Section 255.<sup>327</sup> The FCC has also routinely granted exemptions to its ACS and user interface rules for advanced communications services embedded in television sets and video players,<sup>328</sup> video game systems,<sup>329</sup> e-book readers,<sup>330</sup> and cars.<sup>331</sup>

Somewhat more promising in their scope are the Access Board’s guidelines<sup>332</sup> implementing Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.<sup>333</sup> The guidelines contain relatively comprehensive accessibility guidelines that cover all “[i]nformation and [c]ommunication[s] [t]echnology (ICT),” including devices, broadly defined—and even software, applications, websites, and content.<sup>334</sup> However, Section 508’s coverage is severely limited to ICT procured by federal government agencies,<sup>335</sup> meaning that it requires accessibility of devices only indirectly where vendors sell devices to the government.<sup>336</sup>

In short, there exists no legal regime that comprehensively mandates accessibility for IoT devices. While industry and disability organization representatives on the FCC’s Disability Advisory Committee (of which I am a member) acknowledged the serious shortcomings of accessibility on IoT devices and recommended that the FCC conduct a sweeping study on IoT accessibility,<sup>337</sup> little action has been taken toward this end, and it remains to be seen what legal regimes will develop to address IoT accessibility—a critical component of a comprehensive approach to Internet accessibility.
