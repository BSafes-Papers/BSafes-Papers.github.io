Re: Survey for Dissertation Research

Dear Dr. [Redacted]:

It was great to meet you during Welcome Week at the President’s Reception. As a graduate student in the School of Education at Liberty University, I am conducting research as part of the requirements for an Ed.D. The title of my research project is Prevalence of Cyberbullying Among Traditional Undergraduate Students Attending Faith-Based Universities: A CausalComparative Study. The purpose of my research is to determine the prevalence of cyberbullying by examining the construct based on biological gender and level of religiosity among traditional undergraduate students attending faith-based universities. It will also seek to assist faith-based universities in addressing this timely issue by providing up-to-date, relevant data for administration and faculty, so that they can better facilitate the online safety of their students.

I am writing to request your permission to conduct my research at [Redacted] University. With your permission, I would like to ask [Redacted] students to participate in an anonymous, online survey that will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. Participants will be presented with informed consent information prior to participating. Taking part in this study will be voluntary, and participants will be welcomed to discontinue participation at any time.

Thank you for considering my request. If you choose to grant permission, please provide a signed statement on official letterhead indicating your approval and respond by email to xxxxxxxxxx. As soon I obtain permission from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Liberty University, I will be in contact again to obtain access to your student body email information. Thank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. You can reach me at the email listed above, or by phone at [Redacted].

Sincerely,

Susan Hayes ‘88 McElroy
Doctoral Candidate/Liberty University
