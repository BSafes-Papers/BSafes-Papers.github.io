## I. INTRODUCTION

A rule of thumb is to strike while the iron is hot; for cybercriminals, that iron is a global pandemic.<sup>1</sup> The novel coronavirus dubbed “COVID-19” is an infectious disease that was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.<sup>2</sup> In March 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) officially declared the COVID-19 disease a pandemic following rapid global transmission.<sup>3</sup> This pandemic brought the world to a screeching halt as governments frantically tried to “flatten the curve.”<sup>4</sup> Indeed, COVID-19’s effects permeated nearly every layer

pressing concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic have been the sharp increase in cases, loss of lives, and economic shutdowns, the spike in data breaches and its insidious impact cannot be overlooked.<sup>13</sup>

COVID-19 and its subsequent expansion of work-from-home policies will have lasting implications on the data security of financial institutions.<sup>14</sup> The pandemic forced banks to adapt to a “new normal,”<sup>15</sup> which has entailed a shift away from the physical banking model.<sup>16</sup> This new normal has made digitalization the future of finance and banking in a post-pandemic world.<sup>17</sup> For example, financial institutions saw a decline in the use of cash and a surge in the popularity of contactless payments during the pandemic.<sup>18</sup> The American economy has undergone

an unplanned social experiment, courtesy of the work-from-home model.<sup>19</sup> Cybercriminals have capitalized on the economic turmoil and uncertainty.<sup>20</sup> As more institutions embrace digitalization in order to survive in the increasingly digital world, the consumer data they possess becomes more vulnerable to cyberattacks.<sup>21</sup> Therefore, it is time for financial institutions to perfect their data security measures, while urging lawmakers to reform legislation in light of these updates.<sup>22</sup> Improving data privacy legislation will increase consumer trust in financial institutions, safeguard consumers from additional data injury, and reduce the financial impact companies incur after a breach<sup>23</sup>
