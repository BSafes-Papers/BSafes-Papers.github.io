## APPENDIX D: STUDENT RECRUITMENT EMAIL

Dear Student:
As a graduate student in the School of Education at Liberty University, I am conducting research as part of the requirements for the Doctorate in Education degree. The purpose of my research is to determine how common cyberbullying is, based on biological gender or level of religiosity, for students who attend classes at faith-based universities, and I am writing to invite eligible participants to join my study.

Participants must be at least 18 years old, attend a faith-based university, be a traditional undergraduate student who attends classes on campus (full or part-time), and attends chapel or convocation as part of the curriculum. Participants, if willing, are asked to complete an anonymous survey via Qualtrics XM. The survey consists of demographic questions, the Cyberbullying and Online Aggression Survey, and the Duke University Religion Index, and should take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. Participation is completely anonymous, and no personal, identifying information will be collected.

To participate in this survey, please click on the link provided below to access the Qualtrics XM survey and complete the survey by October 19, 2020:

The first page of the survey is a consent document. The consent document contains additional information about my research. After you have read the consent form, please click the link to proceed to the survey. Doing so will indicate that you have read the consent information and would like to take part in the survey. Thank you!

Sincerely,

Susan Hayes-McElroy
