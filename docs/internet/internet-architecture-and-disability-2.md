## I. TITLE III AND THE INTERNET: THE WEB AS THE INTERNET AND THE WEBSITE AS THE PLACE

As a doctrinal matter, the conceptions of Title III as applied to the Internet most favorable to people with disabilities treat the Internet as the web and websites as places—as in Title III’s “places of public accommodation.” This is partially a result of the ADA’s inception in a pre-Internet society, where the goal of an accessible world necessarily took root in physical places. But it has also proved facile in the context of the Internet; Title III has the capacity to win accessibility cases primarily focused on websites, because websites are easy to understand as metaphorical places. This Part begins with a short history of Title III and its website- and place-centrism, and how it has driven disability-law scholars to theorize about the Internet as the Web and websites as places.

Enacted in 1990, the ADA was intended as a comprehensive and unqualified civil rights remedy for discrimination against people with disabilities. The ADA’s preamble makes explicit that the purpose of the ADA is “to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”<sup>17</sup> In signing it into law, President George H.W. Bush declared that the ADA “signal[ed] the end to the unjustified segregation and exclusion of persons with disabilities from the mainstream of American life.”<sup>18</sup>

If the anti-discrimination goal of the ADA was broadly scoped, its implementation was drawn at least rhetorically with the physical, built world of the late 1980s and early 1990s in mind. Title III, the portion of the ADA intended to deal with the accessibility of private businesses, explicitly prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in “any *place* of public accommodation.”<sup>19</sup> Title III likewise defines public accommodations extensively in terms of places—places of lodging,<sup>20</sup> places of exhibition or entertainment,<sup>21</sup> places of public gathering,<sup>22</sup> places of public display or collection,<sup>23</sup> places of recreation,<sup>24</sup> and places of exercise.<sup>25</sup> Moreover, it illustrates them in terms of traditionally physical buildings—hotels and motels,<sup>26</sup> restaurants and bars,<sup>27</sup> theaters and concert halls,<sup>28</sup> stores and shopping centers,<sup>29</sup> laundromats and banks,<sup>30</sup> museums and libraries,<sup>31</sup> parks and zoos,<sup>32</sup> daycare centers and homeless shelters,<sup>33</sup> and gyms and bowling alleys.<sup>34</sup>

Of course, the legislative history of the ADA makes clear that it was not intended to exclude future technology, noting that “the types of accommodation and services provided to individuals with disabilities, under all of the titles of [the ADA], should keep pace with the rapidly changing technology of the times.”<sup>35</sup> But however Congress might have intended the ADA to apply to the Internet is obscured by the fact that the commercial Internet was essentially nonexistent when the ADA was signed into law in July of 1990.<sup>36</sup> In fact, it was not until five months later that Tim Berners-Lee hosted the first website,<sup>37</sup> five years later that the Federal Networking Council resolved to officially recognize “the Internet” in the form that it more or less exists today,<sup>38</sup> and nearly ten years later than advocates and policymakers first began to debate the applicability of the ADA to the Internet.<sup>39</sup>

A congressional hearing in 2000 previewed the two defining features of the emerging debate over the ADA’s applicability to the Internet. First, the debate would center specifically on the web and websites. The use of websites by private businesses predominated usage of the early Internet, and so the question of website accessibility appeared exhaustive of the question of Internet accessibility.<sup>40</sup> Nearly every witness, whether in support of the ADA’s applicability or against, spoke of the Internet, the web, and websites interchangeably. <sup>41</sup>

Second, the debate would turn on whether the Internet could be conceived of as a physical “place” in the statute’s terms. Some witnesses argued that “[t]he Internet has become a place of public accommodation,”<sup>42</sup> while others argued that“[c]yberspace isn’t a physical place” as contemplated by Title III’s list of “places.”<sup>43</sup>

Nearly two decades of litigation have calcified these features of the debate. First, Internet accessibility under Title III has hinged on whether websites can be properly conceived as places of public accommodation even though they do not occupy a physical space.<sup>44</sup> Nearly all Title III Internet-related litigation has been focused on websites, and primarily on compatibility with screen readers for blind people.<sup>45</sup>

As to the second, even before the Internet became a concern, the federal courts had split over whether Title III was limited to physical places. The leading set of cases split over whether the content of insurance policies, and not simply the physical structure of insurance company *offices*, were covered by Title III.<sup>46</sup>

That split has continued into the era of Title III Internet litigation along three lines:

1. *Nexus-Between-Website-and-Place:* One line of cases, followed by courts in the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits, concludes that websites alone are not public accommodations but can be the subject of a Title III claim to the extent they have a sufficient nexus to a physical place of public accommodation—often found, for example, with websites for retail establishments.<sup>47</sup>

2. *Standalone-Websites-as-Place:* A second line of cases, followed by courts in the First, Second, and Seventh Circuits, concludes that even standalone websites can comfortably be considered places of public accommodation under Title III.<sup>48</sup> The common thread of reasoning in these cases is that websites can be “analogous to a brick-and-mortar store or other venue that provides similar services.”<sup>49</sup>

3. *Physical Places Only (No Websites):* A third line of cases, followed in the Third Circuit, concludes that websites cannot be treated as public accommodations even with a nexus to a physical place of public accommodation.<sup>50</sup>

Advocates and scholars have also become increasingly concerned with the perspective of the Department of Justice (DOJ),<sup>52</sup> which is charged with administering regulations for the implementation of Title III<sup>53</sup> and routinely files amicus briefs and negotiates settlements in website accessibility cases.<sup>54</sup> While DOJ’s view on the applicability of Title III to standalone websites has been historically supportive,<sup>55</sup> a 2010 DOJ rulemaking to implement Title III website regulations languished<sup>56</sup> and then was formally withdrawn in 2017 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.<sup>57</sup>

As a result, much of the disability law literature on Internet accessibility has been dedicated to narrow arguments debating the doctrinal contours of Title III’s applicability to websites in place-centric terms.<sup>58</sup> Many of the articles and notes advocate for resolving the circuit split by treating standalone websites as “places”under Title III,<sup>59</sup> though some have argued in favor of either requiring a nexus from a website to a physical location<sup>60</sup> or limiting Title III’s application to physical sites.<sup>61</sup>

While few scholars have made a broader normative case for applying the ADA to the Internet,<sup>62</sup> some recent scholarship has sought to articulate a theory for Internet accessibility rooted in terms of civil and human rights, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)<sup>63</sup> and First Amendment values of freedom of information, democratic self-governance, personal autonomy, and selfexpression.<sup>64</sup> But that theory, too, has expressly equated *Internet* accessibility with website accessibility.<sup>65</sup> Bradley Areheart and Michael Stein specifically declare in *Integrating the Internet* that their version of “‘Internet accessibility’ . . . is principally concerned with the opportunity to traverse and navigate the Internet, which means *mediating and utilizing the Internet’s constituent websites*.” <sup>66</sup> Victoria Ekstrand acknowledges the importance of Internet accessibility in other contexts, such as devices and networks, but declares the proliferation of cases under Title III warrants a specific focus on websites.<sup>67</sup> Peter Blanck likewise speaks primarily to the importance of making “web content” accessible.<sup>68</sup>

Likewise, recent Internet accessibility scholarship has advocated for web accessibility in explicitly place-centric terms, even beyond those imposed by Title III itself. Areheart and Stein argue in *Integrating the Internet* that the ADA should be interpreted broadly to cover the Internet by channeling disability pioneer Jacobus tenBroek’s seminal (and pre-ADA) right “to live in the world” to a right to “live in the Internet.”<sup>69</sup> Areheart and Stein argue that “[f]or a growing number of people, the Internet is their world—*a place* where one can do nearly everything one needs or wants to do.”<sup>70</sup> Ekstrand argues that “the Internet serves as another important place of public accommodation for disabled citizens,” citing the Supreme Court’s holding in *Packingham v. North Carolina* that websites are “the principal sources for . . . speaking and listening in the modern public square.”<sup>71</sup> Blanck similarly points to the Supreme Court’s description of the web as a “sprawling mall offering goods and services” in *Reno v. ACLU* as an “encouraging” metaphor for resolving Title III’s applicability to websites.<sup>72</sup>

Both litigation and academic efforts to address Internet accessibility have consistently cast the web as a proxy for the Internet and conceptualized websites as places under the meaning of Title III. In the next Part, I position Title III in the context of Internet law’s internal/external perspectives literature to unpack the consequences of disability advocates’ and scholars’ place- and website-centric approach.
