## IV. THE PRESENT IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE BANKING INDUSTRY

### *A. How the Pandemic Changed the Landscape of Banking*
“Before COVID-19, these types of digital applications were nice to have. Now it’s a necessity.”<sup>177</sup> This statement made by Anne Chow, the chief executive officer of AT&T, reflects how digital applications have become a lifeline for every bank during the pandemic as social distancing protocols have interrupted regular operations.<sup>178</sup> The Department of Homeland Security deemed the financial services sector a Critical Infrastructure Sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, which means financial services workers have a “special responsibility” to maintain their normal work schedules.<sup>179</sup> However, banks have had to adopt new ways to continue their operations while ensuring their adherence to public health and safety guidelines.<sup>180</sup>

Adapting to a “new normal” has forced banks to restrict in-person consumer access.<sup>181</sup> For instance, the FDIC has allowed its member

banks to limit consumer access to physical branch offices.<sup>182</sup> Similarly, the OCC has recognized that, considering the pandemic, there may be temporary bank closures and limited access to in-person services.<sup>183</sup> Needless to say, the financial services industry has had to increasingly rely on technology to continue operating their businesses remotely.<sup>184</sup>

The pandemic has also spawned unprecedented levels of telework.<sup>185</sup> For example, 84% of Deutsche Bank’s investment banking division is currently working remotely.<sup>186</sup> JPMorgan Chase is alternating its 60,950 employees between office and remote work for an indefinite period of time.<sup>187</sup> As telework surges, the OCC recommends that remote bank employees be extra vigilant and use secure communications while working at home.<sup>188</sup> The recommended measures include using virtual

While the pandemic has presented an opportunity for increased telework, it has also presented a crisis through the increased number of cyberthreats.<sup>189</sup> Therefore, cybersecurity is more important than ever <sup>190</sup> In addition, history shows that there is a correlation between increased cybercrime and economic turmoil.<sup>192</sup> Indeed, cybercrime reportedly increased 33% during the 2008 financial crisis.<sup>193</sup> Just in the first quarter of 2020, the number of data breaches is up 273% compared to last year.<sup>194</sup> Undoubtedly, hackers are capitalizing on the upheaval and fear caused by the virus.<sup>195</sup>

mitigate the economic fallout resulting from COVID-19, the government has issued trillions of dollars in relief funds through their COVID-19 response bill legislation (the “CARES Act”).<sup>197</sup> The most visible relief has been in the form of Economic Impact Payments (“EIP”), also known as stimulus checks.<sup>198</sup> Eligible taxpayers—individuals whose income was below $99,000—received a one-time EIP payment of $1,200.<sup>199</sup> Joint households whose income was below $198,000 received a one-time EIP payment of $2,400.<sup>200</sup> Unfortunately, the availability of stimulus funds “ring[s] the dinner bell for hackers.”<sup>1201</sup> Cybercriminals have assumed false identities and set up malicious websites to steal these stimulus funds.<sup>202</sup> Indeed, despite the global health crisis, cybercrime is speeding up.<sup>203</sup> Total traffic at the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit organization that helps data breach victims, was up 850% in March compared to 2019.<sup>204</sup> The FTC reported increased cases of identity fraud since the pandemic started.<sup>205</sup> Federal agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation have even issued warnings of cybercriminals attempting to capitalize on the pandemic.<sup>206</sup>

While individuals and families have suffered from cybercrime during the pandemic, federal agencies have also been hurt.<sup>207</sup> On March 25, 2020, the Small Business Administration discovered a data breach that compromised the information of 7,913 businesses applying for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) program.<sup>208</sup> The EDIL program offers each applicant up to $2 million in loans.<sup>209</sup> It was the only source of emergency funding for many businesses before Congress enacted the $2 trillion CARES Act to provide COVID relief.<sup>210</sup>

Bank of America suffered from a data breach on April 22, 2020, impacting customers who applied for the Paycheck Protection Program;<sup>211</sup> another program created by the CARES Act to encourage businesses to keep employees on its payroll.<sup>212</sup> Saying that only a “small number” of customers were affected, Bank of America has not disclosed the specific number of breached applications.<sup>213</sup> In response to the breach, Bank of America (1) ordered an investigation, (2) advised clients to review their account statements carefully and report suspicious activity, and (3) offered clients free two-year membership of Experian’s identity theft program.<sup>214</sup>
