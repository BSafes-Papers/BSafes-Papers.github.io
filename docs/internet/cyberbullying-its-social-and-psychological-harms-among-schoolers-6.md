## Conclusion
The important thing in human relations is a consideration, respect, and concern for others. However, if these concerns and considerations are distorted and appear as violence, no one will want to engage. With the development of technological civilization, many people are changing to a society that places indirect contact over a face-to-face, personal work rather than collaboration, and anonymity rather than naming. As Aristotle said, however, humans are social animals (see Loard, 2013); we seek the meaning of our existence under constant relationships with others. Because of this, violence in relations force to leave more profound and fatal wounds on the victim. In particular, bullying victimizations during the sensitive adolescence period may place unforgettable scars on the victims remaining life. This current study empirically demonstrated the possibility that such wounds, social and psychological harms, can be alleviated and restored by the support of adults and peers. Moreover, the current study indicates that psychological harm is more prevalent among cyberbullying victims compared to social harm, which warrants intervention and prevention programs to mediate existing psychological harm and reduce future harm by cyberbullying. Even though the percentage of experiencing social harm is relatively lower compared to psychological harm, the presence of social harm also cannot be ignored, and warrant intervention and prevention. Based on findings, we believe that developing new adult and peer supporting programs or enhancing existing assisting programs can be vital methods to help distressed students recovery process, while enhancing knowledge on cyberbullying: prevention and danger. It is people who cause problems, and it is also people who solve the problems. Perhaps being wounded by a person and healed by another person is a way that we live in society. There is growing evidence of the effectiveness of peer supporting programs across the literature (Adickes et al., 2013; Tzani-Pelpelasi et al., 2019. Williford et al., 2012; Yerger and Gehret, 2011). The sustainability of such programs, however, needs to be carefully managed with surrounding factors within the school environment and students characteristics.
