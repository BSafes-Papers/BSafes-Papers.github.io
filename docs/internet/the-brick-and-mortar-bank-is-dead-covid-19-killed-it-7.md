## VII. CONCLUSION

The financial services industry is overdue for a digital shakeup, and the security measures banks take in protecting consumer data need to be updated.<sup>301</sup> Massive breaches like Equifax and Capital One, along with the recent breaches seen during the pandemic, confirm the great length cybercriminals will go to in order to steal personal information.<sup>302</sup> As companies implement permanent work-from-home options, the financial services sector needs to be ready for a “new normal” in a postpandemic world.<sup>303</sup> The reimagined financial industry should include full digitalization of the banking industry, comprehensive work-from-home plans, and amendments to existing privacy legislation to accommodate an increasingly remote workforce. Brick-and-mortar banks are becoming a thing of the past, and digital banks are on the rise. To survive, the industry must adapt.
