## III. DATA PROTECTION LAWS REGULATING CONSUMER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

### *A. Federal Law*
There is no single, uniform federal law regulating personal data collection in the United States.<sup>120</sup> The Financial Services Modernization Act, included in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”), is the most relevant data protection law pertaining to financial institutions.<sup>121</sup> Specifically, Title V of the GLBA restricts financial institutions’ disclosure of private consumer financial information.<sup>122</sup> Under Title V of the GLBA, financial institutions must (1) respect the privacy of their customers,<sup>123</sup> and (2) protect the security and confidentiality of their customers’ nonpublic personal information.<sup>124</sup> These two provisions provide consumer bankers an absolute right to know how their personal

information will be used.<sup>125</sup> Congress outlined a procedure in this provision of the GLBA to safeguard consumer information.<sup>126</sup> This procedure gives consumers the option to opt-out of information sharing with nonaffiliated third parties.<sup>127</sup> In addition, each financial institution is mandated to create a written privacy policy if the institution transfers consumer information to unaffiliated bank entities.<sup>128</sup>

Administrative agencies, such as the federal banking regulators and FTC, are tasked with ensuring compliance.<sup>129</sup> These agencies were left to their own discretion on what rules to promulgate to enforce Title V.<sup>130</sup> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), OCC, and the Federal Reserve Board among other agencies jointly adopted a federal privacy model.<sup>131</sup> The FTC, on the other hand, had the “catch-all” responsibility of enforcing the Title V provisions for “[a]ny other financial institution” not covered by the other regulators.<sup>132</sup> Thus, the FTC implemented two sweeping regulations: a “Financial Privacy Rule,”<sup>133</sup> requiring financial institutions to provide an annual notice to all consumers of the institution’s privacy policies,<sup>134</sup> as well as a “Safeguards Rule,” which forbids financial institutions from obtaining financial information through fraudulent means.<sup>135</sup>

Despite the additional efforts of these federal agencies and regulators, the GLBA still has pitfalls and criticisms—namely that it does

not go far enough to protect consumers.<sup>136</sup> For example, the GLBA offers no private right of action for affected consumers.<sup>137</sup> This problem is compounded by the fact that banks often collect consumer information outside the scope of protections granted by the GLBA, such as when a bank gathers information unrelated to financial services or to the opening of a checking account.<sup>138</sup> Additionally, the GLBA’s consumer opt-out route is subject to exceptions, effectively creating an “informationsharing loophole.”<sup>139</sup> Consequently, a current issue with the GLBA is how to protect consumer data amidst a work-from-home environment, which is a policy matter that will need to be addressed if remote work persists post-pandemic.<sup>140</sup>

While the GLBA is the legal backbone for data protection domestically, legislation here may have fallen behind as compared to international data protection laws.<sup>141</sup> There have been calls for the United States to enact a law similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) that took effect in the European Union (“E.U.”) on May 25,

2018.<sup>142</sup> The GDPR is a data-sharing law intended to give individuals living in the E.U. rights to their personal data and how it is used and collected.<sup>143</sup> Failure to follow the GDPR’s regulations can result in fines as high as $22.6 million or even as much as 4% of the company’s annual revenue.<sup>144</sup>

The reach of the GDPR is not exclusive to Europe.<sup>145</sup> In fact, it has sweeping effects on U.S. companies.<sup>146</sup> According to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, the GDPR has resulted in U.S. companies investing billions of dollars in cybersecurity in order for their privacy policies to be GDPR-compliant.<sup>147</sup> However, these expenditures may not be isolated occurrences.<sup>148</sup> Other countries are following the E.U.’s lead and are revising their own data protection laws.<sup>149</sup> For example, Canada amended its Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents

Act, which now significantly overlaps with the GDPR.<sup>150</sup> Similarly, Australia published additional guidance on its Privacy Act of 1988 to address updates triggered by the GDPR.<sup>151</sup> A key difference between the E.U. approach and the U.S. approach is that the latter is macro-focused.<sup>152</sup> Specifically, the U.S. targets its legislation towards cybersecurity and breaches, while the E.U. places its emphases on personal privacy.<sup>153</sup> Regardless, the GLBA merely sets a floor which permits states to enact more stringent privacy laws.<sup>154</sup>

### *B. State Law*
Unless a more comprehensive federal law for data privacy is enacted, data protection in the United States is dependent on a “patchwork system” of state laws.<sup>155</sup> While all fifty states have data breach laws, these laws require little more than just notification that a breach has occurred.<sup>156</sup> However, some states like New York and California have taken steps forward to improve data security and the personal privacy of its residents.<sup>157</sup> New York’s Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) has enacted a set of cybersecurity regulations targeted specifically at financial institutions known as “Reg 500.”<sup>158</sup> These regulations were created to guard against the threat posed by cybercriminals and to protect consumers from intrusion upon their private

California has passed the most comprehensive state data protection law: the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).<sup>164</sup> In fact, the CCPA has been dubbed with the nickname “GDPR-lite” and the “California GDPR.”<sup>165</sup> The CCPA provides consumers with four key rights: (1) the right to know, (2) the right to be forgotten, (3) the right to opt out, and (4) the right to equal service and price.<sup>166</sup> Any business that collects personal information of California residents is subject to its provisions, including financial institutions.<sup>167</sup> While it is still too early to gauge the CCPA’s long-term impact, companies both in the United States and across the world are asking for more time to comply in putting their new privacy practices in place.<sup>168</sup> Despite pleas from both U.S.-based

and international companies for more time to absorb the shock of compliance, the California Attorney General is resolute—no one gets extra time.<sup>169</sup> However, the CCPA’s collection and storage policies may have been complicated by novel situations arising out of the pandemic.<sup>170</sup> Businesses are now collecting physiological data of consumers, such as body temperature, prior testing results, and contact tracing via cell phones.<sup>171</sup> The nature of how to collect, store, and maintain that personal data is unaddressed in the CCPA, proving that privacy laws need to be continuously updated to reflect the changing times.<sup>172</sup>

Since California took a strong stance to ensure personal privacy protection, sixteen other states have introduced comprehensive state privacy bills—a sign that the “patchwork system” may be improved.<sup>173</sup> Moreover, Congress has proposed the COVID-19 Consumer Data Protection Act, which would (1) provide Americans more transparency over their personal data like health records and location data, and (2) hold businesses accountable if they use such personal data to fight the pandemic.<sup>174</sup> This bill takes GDPR-esque steps by zeroing in on personal privacy protections.<sup>175</sup> One of the sponsors of the bill, Senator Jerry
