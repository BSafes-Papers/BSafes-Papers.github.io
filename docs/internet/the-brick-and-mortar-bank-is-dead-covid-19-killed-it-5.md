## V. THE FUTURE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE BANKING INDUSTRY

The increased rate of cybercrime coincides with a time in which there is a greater push for employees to work remotely.<sup>215</sup> In fact, a group of U.S. senators stated: “Telework protects not only federal employees from the spread of COVID-19, but also their families and the communities across the country in which they work.”<sup>216</sup> This sentiment proposes a federal stamp of approval on a growing practice: the maximization of telework.<sup>217</sup> This was arguably the first time that telework is lauded not just because it is convenient but also because it is a good public health safety measure.<sup>218</sup> The shift to remote work—for both public and private sectors—has been well received.<sup>219</sup> Survey data reports that 98% of workers would like to work-from-home permanently.<sup>220</sup> Companies including Twitter, Slack, and Square have already announced a work-from-home forever option for their employees.<sup>221</sup> Facebook expects half of its 48,000 employees to workfrom-home throughout the next ten years.<sup>222</sup> Additionally, several

companies like Shopify and Box anticipate having permanent workfrom-home options in the future.<sup>223</sup> Remote work is projected to stay in the post-pandemic world.<sup>224</sup>

However, the reality of the transition to remote work during the pandemic is less than ideal.<sup>225</sup> Scores of financial institutions were ill equipped to make the transition to remote work.<sup>226</sup> Many information technology (“IT”) departments were not prepared to handle the substantial increase in remote employees and third-party vendors.<sup>227</sup> Employees were not prepared for the transition either.<sup>228</sup> A survey of remote workers shows that 72% are not working from a dedicated home office space.<sup>229</sup> Instead, their living rooms and bedrooms serve as their “office.”<sup>230</sup> Moreover, 40% of remote workers are not even working from an actual desk.<sup>231</sup>

People change their behaviors when they transition from an office environment to a home environment.<sup>232</sup> Therefore, the key concern with a surge in telework is maintaining a safe cybersecurity environment.<sup>233</sup> The risk of data harms stems not only from cybercriminals but also from employees themselves.<sup>234</sup> A study conducted by the security firm Tessian found that 48% of employees are less likely to follow safe data practices at home.<sup>235</sup> An alarming 52% of those surveyed said they believed they could get away with riskier behavior,<sup>236</sup> such as using public hotspots and unsecure networks.<sup>237</sup>

These risks associated with unsupervised telework include, but are not limited to, unsecure networks, phishing attacks, computer sharing, and insecure devices.<sup>238</sup> Employees may have weaker protocols in their homes, like using WEP (the weakest protocol and highly vulnerable to attacks) instead of WPA-2 (the most secure protocol) in securing their Wi-Fi networks.<sup>239</sup> If a remote workforce is to be a permanent
