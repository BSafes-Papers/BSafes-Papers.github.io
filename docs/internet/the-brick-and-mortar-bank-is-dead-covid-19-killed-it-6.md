## VI. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NAVIGATING BANKING POST COVID-19 

COVID-19 has accelerated technology usage and increased the popularity of contactless payments.<sup>240</sup> The CEO of Israel’s oldest bank, Bank Leumi, has stated that the days of consumers visiting bank branches and consulting bankers in-person is “passé.”<sup>241</sup> Therefore, financial institutions will need to be digital-ready.<sup>242</sup> Banks need to make large investments in digital technology to improve their cyber-resiliency as the industry shifts away from a physical banking structure.<sup>243</sup>

Digital transformation is an ongoing process whereby businesses adapt to changes in customers and markets by leveraging digital competencies.<sup>244</sup> Being “digital-ready” could include: (1) banks integrating technologies like artificial intelligence or robotics into daily operations;<sup>245</sup> (2) banks promoting and improving use of banking functions (e.g. withdrawing money or applying for loans) through online

At the same time, concerns have been raised about whether physical cash could spread the coronavirus. This has contributed to a 57% fall in cash usage among respondents, alongside a rise in payments using credit cards (7% net), debit cards (10% net) and online payment tools (14% net).”).

platforms like smartphones;<sup>246</sup> (3) banks opting to go paperless;<sup>247</sup> and finally (4) banks recognizing a minimal need for direct interaction with clients given the array of digital platforms for communication.<sup>248</sup> Now more than ever, it is important to have financial service organizations invest in the best technology available especially for remote-work capabilities such as 5G networks, VPNs, document capture, digital signatures, and mobile channels for banking.<sup>249</sup> Implementing and continually improving banking technologies will cater to the growing number of “digital-first, branch-second approach” consumers.<sup>250</sup>

First, banks need to perfect their mobile banking. Indeed, the pandemic is hastening the pace at which banks are converting to online platforms.<sup>251</sup> For example, Bank Leumi expanded to create Pepper, Israel’s first mobile-only bank.<sup>252</sup> Built off of the customer base of Bank Leumi, Pepper has been able to circumvent consumer trust issues by building its reputation off the success of its parent company.<sup>253</sup> Pepper might actually be more popular than its parent company<sup>254</sup> because it has opened more accounts per day than Bank Leumi.<sup>255</sup> Moreover, Barclays launched a fully online bank in the United States, and regional banks like

Capital One anticipate launching online spin-off institutions.<sup>256</sup> Given the majority of consumers that prefer a digital relationship with their bank, <sup>257</sup> there is an advantage for banks in deferring to online banking platforms.<sup>258</sup> With less overhead needed for operating a digital platform, banks could entice new customers by offering lower fees and higher interest rates on checking accounts.<sup>259</sup>

Second, banks need to develop a work-from-home operating model. Some companies are already ahead of the game.<sup>260</sup> For instance, JPMorgan Chase has developed a pilot program dubbed “Project Kennedy,” which calls for 10% of its 127,135 employees to work from home.<sup>261</sup> Project Kennedy is meant to serve as a contingency plan in the event that COVID-19 leads to more disruptions to in-person banking.<sup>262</sup> The plan will be in effect for an indeterminate period of time.<sup>263</sup> Pilot work-from-home programs like Project Kennedy can provide banks with the confidence and experience when dealing with a remote workforce.<sup>264</sup> JPMorgan Chase has already seen a significant increase in revenue and net income since implementing its work-from-model.<sup>265</sup> Their success can provide an incentive for other banks to work towards the same.

A potential operating model could incorporate a hybrid of remote and in-person work.<sup>266</sup> Specifically, banks could alternate portions of its employees between at-home and in-person roles, while also offering a permanent work-from-home option for certain employees.<sup>267</sup> This hybrid model would reduce the need for a large office space since a smaller portion of the bank’s workforce would be on-site at any given time.<sup>268</sup> The need for designated workstations for employees would also decrease.<sup>269</sup> It would be more practical to provide employees with temporary workstations as opposed to designated permanent spaces.<sup>270</sup> Maintaining a hybrid telework model would guarantee that banks are upto-date with the newest technologies and have well equipped information technology departments.<sup>271</sup> Given that increased digitalization also increases the risk of cyberattacks, telework incentivizes banks to maintain up-to-date systems and remain vigilant against cyber-risks.<sup>272</sup> The key elements in implementing this hybrid model could include: ensuring employees have the requisite technologies, securing connections, implementing team communication platforms, and setting clear

expectations on appropriate cyber-practices.<sup>273</sup> By investing capital into providing online services, banks can stay connected with consumers while still maintaining the quality of their services.<sup>274</sup>

The advantages for increased telework are clear.<sup>275</sup> While banks can realize a multitude of savings on office rent and supplies,<sup>276</sup> employee morale can be boosted as well.<sup>277</sup> Telework can even allow banks to dip into a more competitive and inclusive applicant pool since coming into the office is no longer essential.<sup>278</sup> The need to regularly come into the office can impose a significant hardship for some groups of people.<sup>279</sup> Eliminating the requirement for in-person work can offer more opportunities for people with disabilities and parents who seek employment in the banking industry.<sup>280</sup> Additionally, banks could benefit from increased corporate responsibility resulting from the telework model.<sup>281</sup> Remote employees will rely less on the need for

Finally, policymakers need to consider the pragmatic effects of a remote workforce and amend existing privacy legislation in consideration of it.<sup>283</sup> The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 (“Telework Act”) is the most recent federal remote-work legislation,<sup>284</sup> which applies solely to executive agencies.<sup>285</sup> Under the Telework Act, federal agencies must (1) designate a telework managing officer (who is the primary contact point for telework matters),<sup>286</sup> (2) require all remote employees to complete telework training,<sup>287</sup> and (3) demand written agreements from all agencies setting forth their telework plan.<sup>288</sup> Furthermore, a push for new telework legislation has resurged in the form of the Pandemic Federal Telework Act (“Pandemic Telework Act”),<sup>289</sup> which, if passed, would require all federal agencies to maximize telework and expand the number of employees required to telework for the duration of COVID19.<sup>290</sup> The expansion of telework would remain in effect until the COVID-19 public health emergency ends.<sup>291</sup> While the Telework Act and Pandemic Telework Act are aimed solely at federal employees, telework is more common in the private sector.<sup>292</sup> Thus, a comprehensive

federal telework act—covering both public and private employment sectors—could provide a framework for companies pursuing a permanent remote workforce in the future.<sup>293</sup>

Ensuring the safety and soundness of consumer financial data necessitates regulatory oversight of remote work.<sup>294</sup> Key provisions proposed in the Pandemic Telework Act would benefit from inclusion in a comprehensive federal telework act.<sup>295</sup> Such provisions include a determination of precisely which employees are telework-eligible,<sup>296</sup> and an implementation of mandatory telework training for supervisors and managers.<sup>297</sup> Given that many employees were not prepared to make the remote-work transition at the onset of the pandemic,<sup>298</sup> understanding which bank employees will telework is necessary for ensuring that these employees will be well equipped.
