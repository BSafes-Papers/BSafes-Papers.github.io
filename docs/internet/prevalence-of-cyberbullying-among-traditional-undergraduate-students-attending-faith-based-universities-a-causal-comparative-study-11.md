## APPENDIX E: PARTICIPANT CONSENT FORM

**Title of the Project:** Prevalence of Cyberbullying among Traditional Undergraduates Attending Faith-Based Universities: A Causal-Comparative Study

**Principal Investigator:** Susan Hayes-McElroy, Ed.S. Doctoral Candidate, Liberty University

### Invitation to be Part of a Research Study
You are invited to participate in a research study. In order to participate, you must be at least 18 years old, attend a faith-based university, be a traditional undergraduate student who attends classes on campus (fulltime or part-time), and who attends chapel, or convocation, as part of your educational requirements. Taking part in this research project is voluntary.

Please take time to read this information and ask questions before deciding whether to take part in this research project.

### What is the study about and why is it being done?
The purpose of the study is to determine how common cyberbullying and online aggression are among traditional undergraduate students who attend a faith-based university. Determining how widespread the issue is can potentially give faculty, administrators, and staff valuable information to help make the campus as safe as possible.

### What will happen if you take part in this study?
If you agree to participate in the study, I would ask you to do the following things: 1. Take an online survey that consists of demographic questions, the Cyberbullying and Online Aggression Survey, and the Duke University Religion Index that will take approximately 10 – 15 minutes to complete.

### How could you or others benefit from this study?
Participants should not expect to receive any direct benefits from taking part in this study.

Benefits to society include (1) an increased knowledge on the topic of cyberbullying and (2) providing relevant, up-to-date data for the university administrators at the faith-based institutions involved in this study.

### What risks might you experience from being in this study?
The risks involved in this study are minimal, which means they are equal to the risks you would encounter in everyday life.

### How will personal information be protected?
The records of this study will be kept private. Research records will be stored securely, and only the researcher will have access to the records. All participant responses will be anonymous. Data will be stored on a password-locked computer and may be used in future presentations. After three years, all electronic records will be deleted.

### Is study participation voluntary?
Participation in this study is voluntary. Your decision whether to participate will not affect your current or future relations with Liberty University. If you decide to participate, you are free to not answer any question or withdraw at any time prior to submitting the survey without affecting those relationships.

### What should you do if you decide to withdraw from the study?
If you choose to withdraw from the study, please exist the survey and close your internet browser. Your responses will not be recorded or included in the study.

### Whom do you contact if you have questions or concerns about the study?
The researcher conducting this study is Susan Hayes-McElroy. You may ask any questions you have now. If you have questions later, you are encouraged to contact her at smcelroy@liberty.edu, or [Redacted]. You may also contact the researcher’s faculty sponsor, Dr. Meredith Park, at mjpark@liberty.edu.

### Whom do you contact if you have questions about your rights as a research participant?
If you have any questions, or concerns, regarding this study, and would like to talk to someone other than the researcher, you are encouraged to contact the Institutional Review Board, 1971 University Blvd., Green Hall Ste. 2845, Lynchburg, VA 24515 or email at irb@liberty.edu.

### Your Consent
Before agreeing to be part of the research, please be sure you understand what the study is about. You can print a copy of the document for your records. If you have any questions about the study later, you can contact the researcher/study team using the information provided above.
