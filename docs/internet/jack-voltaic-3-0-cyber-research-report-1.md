## 1. FOREWORD
During this period of strategic competition, nation-state competitors are attempting to gain strategic advantage by exploiting our Nation’s critical infrastructure sectors. Secure and resilient critical infrastructure is essential for economic and national security. Every day we depend on and take the basic services provided by these sectors for granted. Given the interdependencies of these services, a risk to one can be a risk to all, and our networks are only as strong as their weakest links. To examine these interdependencies, one must look at cybersecurity and physical security from all perspectives. Critical infrastructure stakeholders—including the Department of Defense (DoD) and federal, state, municipal, and private sector partners—must work together to improve our Nation’s resilience. Strong public-private partnerships at all levels are essential to security

The Army Cyber Institute’s (ACI’s) Jack Voltaic (JV) series provides a bottom-up framework that enhances collaboration and creates a safe environment in which participants can assess, plan, and exercise their responses to physical, cyber, and informational attacks. This environment assists in identifying reporting requirements, information-sharing procedures, and incident declaration thresholds while providing a transparency that encourages a whole-of-community approach. For these reasons and others, the JV research project is a valuable tool in the mission to make the United States more cyber-resilient.

Compared to previous iterations, JV 3.0 was unique in several ways. Though it maintained focus on local-level participants, this iteration also explored how cyber disruptions on civilian critical infrastructure could impact the U.S. Army’s ability to project forces. Additionally, JV 3.0 engaged multiple cities within the same region to gain a broader understanding of potential issues and explore diverse approaches to cyber incident response. Finally, the pandemic forced the ACI to transition from its typical on-site event to a distributed event; this new format allowed the ACI to explore its constant goal of providing a repeatable, low-cost, and scalable framework that is available to support local- to national-level exercises.

Finally, JV 3.0 would not have been possible without the ACI’s partners’ commitment and participation. Many thanks to the leaders who continued to support JV 3.0 while addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Special thanks to the more than 200 individuals and 60 organizations who participated in September’s JV 3.0 events virtually across the country. Your patience and persistence made this event possible and increased the Army’s readiness.

The JV series remains important for the ACI because it provides insights and recommendations that are focused on increasing the Army’s and our Nation’s critical infrastructure resiliency. However, the ACI’s work is made possible through strong public-private partnerships. The ACI is thankful for its partners and looks forward to continuing to collaborate with them.
