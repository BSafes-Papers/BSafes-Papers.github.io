## II. BACKGROUND ON DATA SECURITY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY

### *A. Data Breaches and Their Far-Reaching Impact*
A data breach is an unauthorized entry into a database which allows hackers access to consumer information.<sup>30</sup> Breaches have the potential to compromise highly sensitive personal information including: Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, banking information, and passwords.<sup>31</sup> System vulnerabilities allow hackers to invade these databases.<sup>32</sup> The standard assumption is that these hackers are motivated

by financial gain.<sup>33</sup> While evading the risk of prison or federal prosecution, “smart” hackers can make thousands, or even millions, of dollars.<sup>34</sup> Targeted criminal activity is the source of numerous breaches.<sup>35</sup> However, the majority of data breaches are actually caused by human or system error.<sup>36</sup> Human error occurs when employees access data without authorization, handle information or hardware improperly, or violate federal or industry regulations.<sup>37</sup> System error happens when a large amount of data is inadvertently transferred from one system to another.<sup>38</sup> Regardless of the type of error, breaches can have devastating impacts,<sup>39</sup> especially if they are not discovered quickly.<sup>40</sup>

Data breaches may go undetected for weeks and even months,<sup>41</sup> despite the fact that a data breach occurs nearly everyday.<sup>42</sup> In the financial services industry, it takes an average of 233 days to identify and contain a breach.<sup>43</sup> In the meantime, stolen personal information can

Data breaches expose banks to financial, reputational, and legal risks.<sup>48</sup> It is becoming increasingly common for banks to pay millions of dollars in settlements with regulators and then implement new security protocols after a breach.<sup>49</sup> Incidents that compromise consumers’

Another painful repercussion on a bank’s reputation stems from attacks on its credibility.<sup>55</sup> A breach may lead to doubts of the breached bank’s ability to protect its depositors.<sup>56</sup> This mistrust can produce a “trickle-up” panic effect, in which panic amongst depositors triggers a panic amongst lenders.<sup>57</sup> A breach can halt the “operational resilience” of a bank, damaging its ability to transfer credit or facilitate payments.<sup>58</sup> The inability of a bank to function properly could stall economic activity, making lenders anxious.<sup>59</sup> The activity of worried lenders—who doubt the resiliency of the bank—might result in higher margins on the bank’s collateral and cause a drop in the value of its assets.<sup>60</sup>

On the legal side, breaches expose banks to potential class action lawsuits from affected customers.<sup>61</sup> The degree of data protection varies from state-to-state, as do the penalties.<sup>62</sup> Regardless, each state, at the

banks to foster this growing digitalization.<sup>86</sup> For instance, with less overhead costs for operating a digital platform, banks can offer higher interest rates on checking and savings accounts in addition to lower fees.<sup>87</sup> However, this digitalization puts consumer data at greater risk for cyberattacks.<sup>88</sup>

The increase in cyberattacks has led to rising costs in cybersecurity protection for banks.<sup>89</sup> The financial services sector spends three times the amount on cybersecurity safeguards compared to other industries.<sup>90</sup> Regulators agree that data breaches pose a systemic risk to a bank’s operational resilience.<sup>91</sup> As a result, banks typically have safeguards in place including encryption, multifactor authentication, and biometric identity verification.<sup>92</sup> However, these measures are not

foolproof, especially when institutions neglect to patch vulnerabilities.<sup>93</sup> Such neglect has led to two of the most significant breaches: Capital One and Equifax.<sup>94</sup>

Capital One is the United States’ fifth-largest consumer bank and the eighth-largest bank overall.<sup>95</sup> On July 19, 2019, it discovered that a breach compromised the personal information of approximately a hundred million Americans and six million Canadians.<sup>96</sup> The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the bank’s federal regulator, said the breach was linked to problems with Capital One’s cloud migration plan.<sup>97</sup> While the breach occurred in 2019, vulnerabilities within the bank’s cloud migration plan dated back to 2015.<sup>98</sup> Within those four years, Capital One not only failed to implement network security controls, but its internal audits also failed to identify the weaknesses in its cloud operating systems.<sup>99</sup>

Following the breach, Capital One faced steep regulatory fines, was subject to several class-action lawsuits, and its stock plunged.<sup>100</sup>

Capital One notified all affected customers by mail and offered them two years of free credit monitoring.<sup>101</sup> As required by its settlement, Capital One agreed to develop and implement additional cybersecurity protocols.<sup>102</sup> The protocols included (1) appointing a compliance committee charged with sending periodic updates to the OCC, (2) proposing a “Comprehensive Action Plan” detailing its remedial actions, and (3) improving its cloud migration plan.<sup>103</sup>

Longstanding neglect also led the credit-reporting agency Equifax to suffer a massive data breach.<sup>104</sup> Despite being alerted of a critical security vulnerability in March 2017, Equifax’s 225-person cybersecurity team failed to patch the network,<sup>105</sup> and by July 2017, it was too late.<sup>106</sup> Hackers invaded the vulnerable database and gained access to Equifax’s network, compromising the personal data of 147 million consumers in the United States.<sup>107</sup> Unfortunately, the errors did not stop there.<sup>108</sup> After the breach, Equifax accidentally directed users to

Equifax is now at the same place it was before the breach happened.<sup>117</sup> The Capital One and Equifax data breaches ultimately exemplify the farreaching impacts a breach can have on the financial services industry.<sup>118</sup> Unfortunately, the inadequacy of federal and state laws regulating personal consumer data collection exacerbates the frequency and impact of a breach.<sup>119</sup>
