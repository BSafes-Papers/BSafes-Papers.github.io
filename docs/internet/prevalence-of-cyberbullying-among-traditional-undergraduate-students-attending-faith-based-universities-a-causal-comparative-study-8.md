Dear Dr. Koenig:

As a graduate student in the School of Education at Liberty University, I am conducting research as part of the requirements for an Ed.D. in Curriculum and Instruction. The title of my research project is Prevalence of Cyberbullying Among Traditional Undergraduate Students Attending Faith-Based Universities: A Causal- Comparative Study. The purpose of my research is to determine the prevalence of cyberbullying by examining the construct based on biological gender and level of religiosity among traditional undergraduate students attending faith-based universities. It will also seek to assist faith-based universities in addressing this timely issue by providing up-to-date, relevant data for the administration and faculty, so they can better facilitate the online safety of their students.

I am writing to request your permission to utilize the DUREL: Duke University Religion Index, as part of my research. I am also seeking your permission to publish the DUREL as part of my final dissertation. Participants will be asked to complete the DUREL via a link sent to their assigned university email address. Participants will be presented with informed consent information prior to participating. Taking part in this study will be voluntary, and participants will be welcomed to discontinue participation at any time.

Thank you for considering my request. If you choose to grant permission, please provide a signed statement indicating your approval for me to use your instrument and publish the DUREL as part of my final dissertation and send it to me at smcelroy@liberty.edu. I look forward to hearing from you and appreciate your time.

Sincerely,

Susan Hayes-McElroy
