Four days later, on August 28, 1955, Bryant’s husband and brother beat Emmett to death, gouged out his eye, shot him in the head and threw his body, tied to a cottongin fan with barbed wire, into the river. Three days later, the corpse was recovered. It was so disfigured that Till was only identified by his initialed ring. Till’s mother requested the body to be sent back to Chicago and held an open casket funeral so the world could see this atrocious act of racism. On September 23, the all-white jury deliberated for less than an hour before issuing a verdict of “not guilty,” claiming that they believed the state had failed to prove the identity of the body. In 2017, Carolyn Bryant admitted that Till had never touched, threatened or harassed her.

Ghana.

54 *the world’s best range of affordable programs:* IVHQ was founded by New Zealander Dan Radcliffe in 2007. In 2006, upon completing a master’s degree in Finance and Management from the University of Otago in New Zealand, Dan Radcliffe began work at a corporate company, but just three days in, he quit his job because he realized he would never be happy in the corporate financial world. Dan saved up money and then backpacked and volunteered in Kenya. Although Dan loved the experience of volunteering in Kenya, he was disillusioned with the large disparity between what he had paid, and the actual cost of the volunteer trip. So, while in Nairobi, Dan began meeting with potential local partner organizations and in 2007, he took a loan out to register International Volunteer HQ, which, according to their website, has since grown into “the world’s premier volunteer travel organization.” IVHQ has proudly supported 100,000 volunteers abroad since 2007 and strives to “provide trips that are responsible, high quality and affordable.”

IVHQ achieved recognition as a Certified B Corporation in 2015, meaning it joined the ranks of ethical businesses, like Kickstarter and Etsy. “Certified B Corporations are businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose,” the website reads. And IVHQ founder Dan Radcliffe said, “it’s no longer good enough for businesses to think about their success solely in terms of financial performance.” IVHQ essentially serves as a third-party liaison that connects volunteers with local Ghanaian organizations. After the arrival orientation in Accra, IVHQ dropped me off at my host site, which was run entirely by Ghanaian people and I never saw IVHQ again during my first two-month stay. But without IVHQ, there’d been no way I ever would’ve found out about The Potter’s Village.
