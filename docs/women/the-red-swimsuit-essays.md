## ABSTACT
JACQUELINE KNIRNSCHILD: This thesis is a collection of creative non-fiction essays that offers a collage of ethnography, reportage and memoir. *The Red Swimsuit* blurs the lines between what is considered social science, journalism and art. These essays will become part of a booklength work of creative non-fiction that will explore what it’s like to grow up as a woman in a globalized world wrought with social media, hookup culture and cross-cultural interactions. *The Red Swimsuit* provides first-hand experience, reflexive narration, and reflection on life as a member of Generation Z, also known as iGen. (Under the direction of Beth Ann Fennelly)
