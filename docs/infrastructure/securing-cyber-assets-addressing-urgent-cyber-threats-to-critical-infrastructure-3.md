## Moving Forward: Fundamental Change
The time to act is now. As a nation, we need to move past simply studying our cybersecurity challenges and begin taking meaningful steps to improve our cybersecurity to prevent a major debilitating cyber attack.

The Working Group appreciates the Administration’s attention on key issues that were continuously reiterated during this study, including the need to build and sustain a cyber workforce, identify strategies to deter adversaries, and to examine our readiness to respond to a major cyber attack on our electric grid.

### National Vision and Leadership
We envision a national strategy—championed by senior leaders—that will allow government and industry to harness capabilities to successfully deter and withstand aggressive cyber attacks. Achieving a shared vision will require significant near-term and long-term commitments to ultimately achieve:

- Strong **public support and political will** to act in support of cybersecurity as a national priority.
- Strong **leadership** from the most senior levels of government and the private sector.
- Federal cyber authorities and capabilities are **aligned, coordinated, and easily accessible** across government and the private sector.
- Businesses receive **incentives and technical assistance** to meet basic standards for cybersecurity.
- The nation is positioned to **effectively protect and defend against cyber attacks**, mitigate the impact of cyber attacks, and quickly respond and recover following an incident.
- The United States is a **world leader in cybersecurity**. USA, Inc.—the concept of the public and private sector working seamlessly together like a unified business unit—has cemented its position as a world leader in cyber technology and cyber workforce.

**Our nation needs direction and leadership to dramatically reduce cyber risks. The NIAC stands ready to continue to support the President in this area.**
