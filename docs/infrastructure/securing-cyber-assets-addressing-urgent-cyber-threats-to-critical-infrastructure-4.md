## Appendix A. Study Methodology
The private sector and federal government are extensively examining cyber risks in both individual and coordinated efforts. Over the past few years, a robust body of good work has been completed that has outlined the current cyber risk landscape, the need to take action, and what needs to be done. In this crowded space, the NIAC’s distinct value lies in its ability to provide insights from senior-level, private sector owners and operators into how the government can best work with the private sector to secure the most critical infrastructure assets.

### Charge to the NIAC
The May 11, 2017, *Presidential Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure* (EO 13800) called for improving the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure at greatest risk by applying existing federal authorities and capabilities. On May 15, 2017, the White House through the NSC tasked the NIAC to review existing federal authorities and capabilities, and examine how they could be employed to assist and better support the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure assets that are at greatest risk of an attack that could reasonably result in catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety, economic security, or national security

### Study Approach
To conduct this study, the Council formed the Cyber Study Working Group made up of nine NIAC members, to examine how existing federal authorities and capabilities could be applied in the private sector. To complete the study, the Working Group:

- **Built on the NIAC Cyber Scoping Study** completed in February 2017. For that study, the Working Group interviewed more than 20 past and present senior leaders in government and the private sector, received four classified and four unclassified briefings, and reviewed many of the recent U.S. strategies and expert reports on how to address cyber risk. The scoping study identified three urgent cyber priorities that were affirmed by this current study:

    - **1.Triage today’s problems**. 
        - Implement immediate and urgent fixes to address the most serious cyber risks to critical infrastructure. Focus on the sectors and set of assets, that if compromised, would result in major economic, safety, and security consequences to the United States.

        - Improve cyber hygiene across all critical infrastructure and consider some form of compliance.

        - Improve information sharing mechanisms, leading to machine-to-machine exchanges.

    - **2.Develop novel approaches for cyber resilience**. 
        - Design next-generation cyber systems that are inherently secure, resilient, and selfhealing, particularly those that control critical functions. Develop solutions that make it extremely difficult and economically unattractive to extract value.

    - **3.Strengthen public-private partnership and leadership**. 
        - Develop effective executive-level, public-private mechanisms to strengthen leadership and efficient decision-making concerning critical cyber incidents and policy actions.

        - Streamline, reconfigure, and clarify roles and responsibilities within the federal government.

- **Focused on the leading-edge, highly critical sectors** of Electricity and Financial Services, which have been cited by the NIAC and other entities, such as the Homeland Security Advisory Council as vital because they underpin the operations of other critical infrastructure sectors. As a result, focusing on these sectors provided broad insights that can be applied in other critical sectors. (See Appendix C for more information). 

• **Leveraged the wealth of existing information and built on the body of extensive work examining the nation’s cybersecurity**. For example, the most recent and most comprehensive of which was the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity (CENC) *Report on Securing and Growing the Digital Economy,* published in December 2016. The CENC—comprised of 12 representatives from industry, academia, and former government officials—identified six imperatives, 16 recommendations, and 52 specific actions to move forward. The recommendations address many of the challenges identified in this and other studies, including cyber workforce development, increasing research and development, and better aligning and understanding federal and private sector roles and responsibilities. 

• **Identified industry cyber needs** and started with the assumption that federal authorities and capabilities exist and could be applied to the private sector. 

• **Conducted interviews** with 22 senior leaders and experts in government and the private sector, including five individuals who were also interviewed during the NIAC Cyber Scoping Study. (See Appendix B for a list of interviewees and report contributors). In total, the Working Group built on information from interviews with 38 senior leaders and experts between the two closely-linked studies. 

• **Reviewed list of more than 140 different federal capabilities and related authorities provided to the Working Group in July 2017** to identify capabilities that aligned with industry needs and existing capabilities highlighted in interviews and research.

### Appendix C. Urgency of Cyber Threats to Critical Sectors 
Given the short-time frame for this study, the Working Group focused on sectors facing urgent threats that exemplify the complexity and scale of the cyber challenge for the nation’s critical infrastructure. The Electricity and Financial Services Sectors are not only interconnected, but also underpin all other sectors. The Homeland Security Advisory Council (HSAC) Cybersecurity Subcommittee stated in its 2016 report that these sectors along with the Communications Sector face rapidly growing cyber threats, and because of other sectors’ reliance on them, could be attractive targets for a cyber attack. <sup>2</sup> A large-scale cyber attack on one of these sectors could cause cascading effects across multiple sectors, threatening public health and safety, as well as economic and national security.

### 1. Increasing Sophistication and Intent of Cyber attacks 
Over the past 25 years, the technical knowledge needed to launch an attack has decreased. Malicious cyber tools and exploits can be easily found on the Internet and may be used by lone actors, organized criminal and terrorist groups, or nation-states. At the same time, the sophistication of cyber attacks has increased. For example, the Stuxnet attack, first discovered in 2010, disrupted Iranian nuclear facilities through a series of events: the malware infiltrated Windows systems through USB drives, then autonomously spread to programmable logic controllers that ultimately destroyed 984 uranium enrichment centrifuges.<sup>3</sup> Stuxnet showcases an early case of successfully targeting industrial control systems (ICS), and illustrates how a cyber attack can have very serious physical consequences.

> "Experts agree that the [cyber] threat is so grave because barriers to entry are extremely low while potential rewards are great." - NSA General Counsel Glenn Gerstell, Keynote address at Duke Law's Center on Law, Ethics and National Security 2017 Conference

Not only are attacks more sophisticated: attributing attacks to specific actors is difficult, if the cyber intrusion is even detected. As more devices become Web-enabled or connected to a network, the number of cyber intrusions increases. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) reported 290 cyber attacks on critical infrastructure control systems in fiscal year 2016.<sup>4</sup>

In the second installment of its Quadrennial Energy Review, published in January 2017, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) stated: 

“In the current environment, the U.S. [electric] grid faces imminent danger from cyber attacks, absent a discrete set of actions and clear authorities to inform both responses and threats. Widespread disruption of electric service because of a transmission failure initiated by a cyber attack at various points of entry could undermine U.S. lifeline networks, critical defense infrastructure, and much of the economy; it could also endanger the health and safety of millions of citizens.”<sup>5</sup>

### 2. Ability to Attack Physical Systems through Cyber Means
All businesses face the threat of cyber attacks on their business networks, customer accounts, communication systems, Websites, and proprietary data. Many critical infrastructure companies, however, face additional threats to their operational technology (OT) systems—often called ICS or supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)—which operate physical processes such as the generation, processing, and delivery of power, water, fuels, and chemicals; and the controls for communication and transportation. Cyber attacks on OT can potentially disrupt vital services, damage critical equipment, threaten human health and safety, and trigger disruptions in other sectors.

> **Operational Technology != Information Technology**
>* Web-enabled sensing and measuring technologies have enabled the critical systems to become more reliable and automated, but have also created more vulnerabilities that differentiate OT from IT:*
> - *Compromise of OT can disable operations, disrupt critical services to customers, and damage highly specialized equipment.*
> - *OT must be able to survive a cyber incident while sustaining critical functions.*
> - *Many OT systems must operate in real-time with 24/7 availability and are unable to go offline for patching or upgrades.*
> - *OT components may be very simple devices and may not have enough computing resources to support additional cybersecurity capabilities.*
> - *OT components may be widely dispersed and located in publicly accessible areas where they are subject to physical tampering.*

Cyber-connected OT devices have significantly improved automation and efficiency in the monitoring and measurement of critical functions, but these new efficiencies also introduce vulnerabilities. Traditionally, OT security—particularly in the Electricity Sector—has relied on obscurity and specialization in keeping threat actors from disrupting ongoing operations.<sup>6</sup> An individual utility’s system was highly customized to meet the needs of its customers and might only be compatible with components from a specific vendor; these characteristics limited an attacker’s ability to find and execute exploits against grid components.

Unlike the central SCADA or information technology (IT) systems, OT systems are not automatically updated with service packs, new releases, and bug fixes. In reality, the OT devices are often running the same software as when they were installed 10-15 years ago at a time when physical separation form the network IT systems was considered secure.<sup>7</sup>

Upgrading, replacing, or patching network components could result in an interruption of service, and even a brief interruption can have cascading effects on how other sectors function. These systems also cannot simply be turned off when an attack is detected. OT security technologies require not only focusing on detecting attacks, but maintaining functionality during them.

Figure 1 is a schematic that highlights the interdependencies between sectors and the SCADA controls that are integral to the operations of electricity, fuels, water, and transportation. If one sector fails, the products and services they provide to other sectors may be disrupted as well.

The U.S. Electricity Sector consists of over 3,300 electricity providers<sup>9</sup> —a mix of publicly- and privatelyowned businesses or municipalities—responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity throughout the country. These systems are all interconnected, and a disruption in one small utility can potentially cascade into a widespread and long-term outage.

In 2015, a major cyber attack caused widespread disruption to power services throughout Ukraine, resulting in 225,000 customers without power. In this attack, three electric distribution companies and several substations in Ukraine were targeted by readily available malware tools.<sup>10</sup> Long-term planning and coordination contributed to the success of this extensive cyber attack; investigations determined that the affected entities were breached about nine months prior through spear-phishing emails.<sup>11</sup>

This was one of the first examples of a targeted and sophisticated cyber attack that disrupted electricity delivery. In addition to causing power disruptions, cyber attacks on the Electricity Sector can damage highly specialized and costly equipment. Recovering from system or equipment failure—particularly in the bulk power system—requires a careful and time-consuming restoration process, which potentially keeps customers stranded in the dark for a long period.

The Financial Services Sector consists of investment institutions, insurance companies, credit and financing organizations, and the infrastructure that enables these businesses to function. <sup>12</sup> These organizations ranging in size from small businesses to multinational corporations, are responsible for millions of dollars in assets.

In 2016, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cited cybersecurity as the biggest risk to the sector. <sup>13</sup> Later that year, the Bangladesh Central Bank’s network was infiltrated by hackers who were able to obtain log-in credentials to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications Network (SWIFT). Access to the network, which allows financial institutions to share information, enabled the hackers to steal over $80 million.<sup>14</sup>

While the SWIFT attack shows the inherent risks to individual financial entities, future sophisticated attacks could result in larger-scale and longer-term disruptions to the economy. Such compromises to the data of major financial institutions can erode consumer confidence. Financial Services Sector disruptions can also have cascading impacts on other sectors that require financial data systems for day-to-day operations. For example, in 2012, several financial institutions large and small withstood coordinated distributed denial-ofservice (DDoS attacks). <sup>15</sup>

### 3. Defining and Unifying Public and Private Sector Roles
Throughout our nation’s history we have developed well-established roles for government and the private sector to manage various kinds of physical risks. For example, if there is a threat of an attack through a missile or bomb, the federal government has a clearly defined role to step in for the common defense of the nation. For cyber threats of a similar scale, the private sector is the first line of defense and the role of the government to defend critical systems it does not own is unclear.

> *“Even though the Internet is now ubiquitous in our lives, cyber remains the only domain where we ask private companies to defend themselves against Russia, China, Iran, and other nation-states.”— Penny Pritzker, former Secretary of Commerce, September 27, 2016, Keynote address at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Cybersecurity Summit*

It is widely agreed that the federal government bears the responsibility of protecing the United States from a major nation-state attack or an attack that could have major public safety, economic, or national security implications. But the traditional roles and responsibilities become less clear in the cyber realm, particularly the shared responsibility between government and industry as cyber attacks become more sophisticated and the potential consequences increase. As it becomes harder and more expensive to protect systems from cyber attacks attacks begin to outpace the capabilities of any individual company, and the government has more of a role to play. How these roles are shared remains a challenge.

Repeatedly throughout the study, the Working Group heard that the federal government should exercise its authority to deter adversaries. The United States has deterrence power as part of its diplomatic tools. It must find a way to extend deterrence capabilities into the cyber domain to make it clear to nation-states and other adversaries that there are consequences for attacks, in the same way there would be in a traditionally physical attack.

#### Shared Need for Cyber Workforce
The federal government and the private sector have both identified the shared need for a larger and more skilled cyber workforce. This talent shortage is expected to grow over the next few years. The Center for Cyber Safety forecasted the workforce shortage will reach 1.8 million unfilled cyber positions by 2022.<sup>16</sup>

In 2016, the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy included a four-pronged government-wide approach to increasing cyber jobs by expanding the workforce through education and training; increasing recruitment and outreach; improving employee retention through developmental opportunities; and identifying specific cybersecurity workforce gaps.<sup>17</sup> The Working Group learned from interviews that there are numerous programs already in place tackling this issue, including the National Science Foundation’s CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service, Defense Information Systems Agency Pathways Program, and the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Study. 

An assessment of the scope and sufficiency of the nation’s cybersecurity workforce and education efforts is already underway to meet requirements of EO 13800.<sup>18</sup> The results of the assessment are expected later this year, and the Working Group has great interest in learning more about the recommendations for growing and sustaining the nation’s cybersecurity workforce.<sup>19</sup>

### 4. Examples of Success
As the comprehensive dataset of more than 140 different federal capabilities and related authorities illustrates, there is an impressive depth of available federal capabilities available today, including capabilities that play a crucial role in cyber defense and information sharing. 

#### National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center
The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) serves as a federal civilian interface for multi-directional and cross-sector information sharing. The NCCIC includes four branches: NCCIC Operations and Integration (NO&I), United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT), and National Coordinating Center for Communications (NCC).<sup>2017</sup> 

The Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC) and Financial Servives Information Sharing Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) both have representatives at the NCCIC, allowing for better collaboration and coordination of information sharing. Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) were frequently identified as successful mechanisms for sharing threat information and working collaboratively within sectors and with government partners.

#### Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center
The E-ISAC is a division of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) that gathers and analyzes security information, coordinates incident management, and communicates mitigation strategies with stakeholders within the electricity industry, across interdependent sectors, and with government partners.<sup>21</sup> The E-ISAC works in collaboration with DOE and the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council (ESCC) to serve as the primary security communications channel for the Electricity Sector and enhances its ability to prepare for, and respond to cyber and physical threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.<sup>22</sup> The EISAC’s success is built on trusted relationships. All information shared with the E-ISAC is protected from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), NERC, and the Compliance and Enforcement Program via signed legal agreements, NERC corporate policy, and physical and logical separation from NERC.<sup>23</sup>

#### Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center
The FS-ISAC is often cited as a successful model that provides member-to-member information sharing, as well as providing various levels of information to arm companies with the information they need to take action. It has almost 7,000 members in more than 30 countries, including banks, credit unions, payment processors, broker-dealers, third party service providers, and insurance companies. The FS-ISAC uses a traffic-light protocol to share different levels of information based on classification. It is also working to establish the Energy Analytic Security Exchange (EASE). This new intelligence sharing community for utilities and energy grid companies is intended to provide members with real-time and “near real-time intelligence, the ability to monitor risks to extended supply chains, and access to cross-industry intelligence.”<sup>24</sup> 

The FS-ISAC is also working to form a more targeted, special interest group for the financial institutions deemed most critical for national and economic security. By taking the lead in this area, the Financial Services Sector is working to improve the cyber capabilities and reduce costs for these entities, and provide a forum for them to engage more intensely with U.S. government agencies. Ultimately, this group could be expanded beyond the Financial Services Sector to include participation of all assets deemed most critical to national and economic security.

#### Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program
The Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP) was also cited as a successful example of an information sharing initiative for rapidly collecting, analyzing, and disseminating threat information among participating utilities. The hardware for capturing network data was first developed by DOE in partnership with its National Labs with the intent of automating data collection and analysis. The data collection is fully automated and analyzed, incorporating input from DOE and the Intelligence Community. The analyses are then distributed as alerts or mitigation measures to participating utilities. While the hardware and analytical capabilities were first developed in the public sphere, CRISP is managed and operated by the E-ISAC. The program’s success is underlined by the fact that it initially faced a number of barriers and resistance from both the private and public sectors (e.g., compliance with privacy laws, classification levels). Utilities participating in CRISP serve over 75 percent of U.S. electricity customers. CRISP’s machine-to-machine threat information sharing platform can also be adapted to enable company-to-company information sharing.

## Appendix D. National Cyber Governance: United Kingdom and Israeli Models
The Working Group repeatedly heard in interviews that the federal government is not organized to effectively deploy existing cyber capabilities and authorities. The United Kingdom (UK) and Israel were cited as models of nations that faced major cyber threats and challenges, which triggered a reorganization of how these governments approached cybersecurity. Below is a brief overview of what those countries have in place, should the United States decide to move forward with a fundamental restructuring of cyber authorities.
Overall there are three key takeaways:
- 1.The national government has established one central point of federal cyber authority.
- 2.Cyber offense, including attribution and strike-back capabilities, is identified as a clear responsibility that government plays in deterring cyber adversaries.
- 3.Cyber defense and cyber technology leadership are inextricably linked. 

### 1. Cyber Efforts in the United Kingdom
#### National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2022
In November 2016, the UK published its plan to make the UK more secure and resilient in cyberspace. The strategy includes three main objectives: 1) defend against evolving cyber threats and effectively respond to incidents, 2) deter and disrupt hostile action, and take offensive actions if needed, and 3) develop the cybersecurity industry, research and development (R&D), and talent needed.<sup>25</sup> It also included a £1.9 billion investment. 

The strategy established that the government is ultimately responsible for assuring the country’s cyber resilience, and that the UK would not accept the risks created by businesses not taking the necessary steps to manage cyber threats.<sup>26</sup>

#### National Cyber Security Centre
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was launched in October 2016 and officially opened in February 2017 “to be the authority on the UK’s cyber security environment, sharing knowledge, addressing systemic vulnerabilities, and providing leadership on key national security issues.” The NCSC is a public-facing organization with reach back to the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the UK equivalent of the National Security Agency (NSA), and is intended to provide a unified source of threat intelligence.<sup>27</sup> 

The NCSC replaced three cyber organizations—the Centre for Cyber Assessment (CCA), Computer Emergency Response Team UK (CERT UK), and CESG (the GCHQ’s information security arm). Cyber-related responsibilities were also shifted from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI).<sup>28</sup>

#### Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance
The Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA) helps determine cybersecurity priorities, provides strategic direction, and coordinates the government cybersecurity program. OCSIA also supports education and awareness initiatives for the country, works with the private sector to exchange information and promote best practices in cybersecurity, ensures that cyber capabilities are maintained and improved as needed. The office coordinates with the NCSC.<sup>29</sup>

#### Existing Regulations
**General Data Protection Regulation:** A European Union (EU) regulation intended to strengthen and unify personal data protection (including the export of personal data outside the EU). This replaces the data protection directive from 1995, and will become effective in May 2018. It requires business to have capabilities to protect personal data and requires personal data breaches be reported (with fines resulting from breaches an additional possibility). The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and NCSC are working to ensure UK organizations can thrive under the directive.<sup>30</sup>

**The Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive)**: An EU directive that establishes minimum requirements that high-risk organizations and digital service providers should have for cyber protection to ensure these groups build comprehensive cyber risk management programs. It aims to improve cooperation among EU countries in cyber incidents.<sup>31</sup>

### 2. Cyber Efforts in Israel
The **National Cyber Bureau** was created to advance the capabilities outlined in Government Resolution No. 3611 of 2011. The Bureau reports to the Prime Minister (PM) and provides guidance and policy coordination to the PM and across the government. Resolution 3611 also established a national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT). The Bureau is also charged with encouraging cooperation among academia, industry, and government entities to improve cyber defense of national critical infrastructures.<sup>32</sup>

Below are the four main functions of the Bureau:<sup>33</sup>

- 1.**Defending against Cyber Threats:** Develop a national defense strategy and establish cross industry or industry-specific regulation; develop a national cyber situation assessment and cyber threat reference.

- 2.**Promoting the Cyber Defense Industry**: Establish cyber R&D programs and encourage international companies to invest in Israel.

- 3.**Developing Academia and Human Capital:** In Israel, the civilian cybersecurity presence extends from a number of private companies to education and training that encourages young people to pursue work in cybersecurity. This builds upon a national culture that is focused on security and a nearly universal recognition that cyber threats are both imminent and a high priority.

- 4.**International Cooperation:** Develop relationships with state partners with similar cyber goals – promote information sharing, R&D, etc.

In 2015, Resolution 2444 was approved, which established a **National Cyber Defense Authority**, allowing the National Cyber Bureau to focus on strategy, whereas the Authority would focus on operational objectives to improving cyber protection.<sup>34</sup>

- The purpose of the Authority is to “direct, operate, and execute as needed all defensive and operational efforts at the national level in cyberspace, based on a systemic approach, to allow a full and constant defensive response to cyber attacks, including the handling of cyberspace threats and cyber events in real time, formulation of a current situation assessment, gathering and research of intelligence, and work with the special institutions.”<sup>35</sup>

#### Challenges
One of the major criticisms of these recent organizational changes is that the roles and responsibilities of the resulting organizations have not been clear.<sup>36</sup> These criticisms have primarily come from heads of other Israeli security agencies, but are also highlighted in a report from the Knesset’s (Israel’s version of Congress) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.<sup>37</sup>

Since the National Cyber Defense Authority is subordinate to the National Cyber Bureau, there are concerns this structure could hamper the Authority’s work with improving cybersecurity for civilian groups. 

Other conclusions cited in the report are that the Authority should avoid becoming yet another intelligence gathering agency; any regulations put forth by the Authority must take into account and involve all relevant defense and civilian parties; and that the structure of cyber leadership should be reexamined periodically over the next five years. <sup>38</sup>
