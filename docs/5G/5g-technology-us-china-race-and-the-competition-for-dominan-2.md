## Chapter 2: History of 5G

### I. What is 5G

Fifth-Generation wireless, better known as, 5G is the newest generation of cellular technology, which will provide “greater data speeds, lower latency (better responsiveness), and the possibility to simultaneously connect to more devices.”<sup>5</sup> 5G is “engineered to greatly increase the speed and responsiveness of wireless networks.” <sup>6</sup> 5G networks will allow data transmitted over broadband connections to travel “at multigigabit speeds, with potential peak speeds as high as 20 gigabits per second by some estimates. These speeds exceed wireline network speeds and offer latency of 1 millisecond or lower, which is useful for applications that require real-time feedback. 5G will enable a sharp increase in the amount of data transmitted over wireless systems due to more available bandwidth and advanced antenna technology.”<sup>7</sup> In comparison to previous generations such as 4G and 4GLTE, 5G “is 20x faster than LTE-Advanced, which has a peak download speed of 1,000 Mbps. 5G latency (defined as the time to establish a connection) is estimated to be 10 to 20 milliseconds, compared to 4G's average latency of 40 ms. The maximum traffic capacity of 5G is roughly 100x greater

than a typical 4G network.”<sup>8</sup> For example, on a normal 4G network to download a movie to a mobile device will take around 2 minutes, however when operating on a 5G network this process will take only 2-3 seconds.

The most significant upgrade provided by 5G networks is the access to IoT or the “Internet of Things.” The IoT “encompasses everything connected to the internet, but it is increasingly being used to define objects that are able to "talk" to each other. More simply explained, the IoT is made up of devices – from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables – connected together.”<sup>9</sup> IoT allows devices on closed private internet connections to communicate with others thus bringing those networks together. It gives the opportunity for devices to communicate not only within close silos but across different networking types and creates a much more connected world.”<sup>10</sup> The number of IoT devices is greatly increasing each year due to the increasing number of microchips and data that are incorporated into everyday products we use. “The number of IoT devices is projected to grow from seven billion in 2018 to 22 billion by 2025. Market researcher Gartner predicts that by 2020, there will be 26 times more connected things than people, while globally, every second, another 127 devices are connected to the internet.”<sup>11</sup>

5G will make advancements in IoT because it will allow products to become more connected than ever before which will give companies and people countless amounts of data to make products and life more efficient. With the 5G high-speed networks, devices

will be able to communicate fast than ever before. “The exponential increase in connectivity 5G delivers makes it a technological paradigm shift akin to the transition from typewriters to computers, because it enables a single-use device (e.g. a pressure sensor in a pipeline) to conduct digitally automated services (e.g. detecting a leak and sending a notification to a regulator, triggering an alert to a third-party contractor for repair).”<sup>12</sup>

With the implementation of 5G, it will also be possible to transmit data in real time. This means that 100 billion mobile devices around the world would be accessible at the same time. In other words, a connection density of approximately one million devices per square kilometer. At the same time, the new technology will bring an increase in the relative movement speed. This means that connection quality will be much more stable up to a speed of 500 kilometers per hour, thus will bring about enormous benefits, especially for rail travelers. Regardless of smartphones, increasing amounts of data are inevitable in other areas of application. The numbers do not just sound huge, they are huge. For these reasons and many others, 5G IoT will become the new key technology of connectivity.<sup>13</sup> The advancements that will come as a result of this new cellular technology will include “robotics and automation, virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence and machine learning – transforming the scene of smart devices and applications, and the entire operation of digital societies, very likely in ways unimagined today.”<sup>14</sup> It is examples such as these that make 5G so important; the

vastness of these networks and their integration into the innerworkings of human life will make 5G implementation crucial to any country seeking global dominance. While many would think of these advancements as positives, there are also many downsides that I will discuss in depth in this paper. These downsides include evolving security threats such as broader levels on which to attack meaning there will be an exponential rise in potential targets and subsequent attacks of 5G networks.<sup>15</sup>

### II. Where did 5G start? 

For this paper, it is important to first put into context the “generational networks” that have been created in the past 40 years and how these networks changed the world. Moreover, framing these networks and their beginnings will further show the impact that 5G networks will have on the future of the world, and more specifically, why 5G will define which country dominates the world for the next decade or longer.

Since the invention of cellular technology almost 40 years ago, each generation of technology has brought with it an evolved difference from the previous generation. “1G was analog cellular. 2G technologies, such as CDMA, GSM, and TDMA, were the first generation of digital cellular technologies. 3G technologies, such as EVDO, HSPA, and UMTS, brought speeds from 200kbps to a few megabits per second. 4G technologies, such as WiMAX and LTE, were the next incompatible leap forward, and they are now scaling up to hundreds of megabits and even gigabit-level speeds.”<sup>16</sup> In order to explain how the world came from bulky phones that were carried in bags to new, sleek phones

which contain more advanced technology than the first space shuttle, I will provide a brief overview of each generation of cellular technology. 

First generation cellular or “1G” was launched in Tokyo, Japan in 1979 by Nittpon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). By 1984, 1G covered the entirety of Japan. However, it was not until 1983 that the US approved 1G, and the first none-landline phones were sold across America as well as Britain and Canada.<sup>17</sup> While 1G was cutting edge technology, it did have flaws such as little coverage areas and poor sound quality on the large majority of calls. A big security concern which come about with the invention of the first “mobile” phones was the lack of secure networks. Without secure networks, people could listen in on conversations by using radio scanners. Despite this, by the year 1990, Motorola had 20 million global users.<sup>18</sup>

The widespread success of 1G led to the creation of the second generation of mobile network better known as “2G.” 2G was launched in Finland in 1991. The main upgrades from 1G to 2G were the encryption of phone calls as well a drastic improvement in phone call quality. However, the biggest impact of 2G was the creation of text messages and picture messages which allowed people to communicate without talking on the phone. This new digital future of 2G led to massive increases in users all over the world. Because of buyer demand, companies invested in new infrastructure such as cell towers which led to increased speeds and connectivity.<sup>19</sup>

3G was launched by Japanese company NTT and was formulated around increased speed and standardized networks across the country so that international roaming could be made possible on cell phones. 3G increased connectivity speeds, which was 4 times faster than 2G, led to new technology like video calls and video streaming on devices. The most popular phone in the 3G era launched in 2002, the Blackberry. However, in late 2007 at the end of 3G, Apple launched the iPhone which lead to the need for increased technology across the board.<sup>20</sup>

4G was first deployed in Sweden and Norway in 2009 and became known as 4G LTE Standard. 4G offered fast mobile web access which allowed users access to HD video streaming, faster message services, Facetime calls, and increased mobile games. 4G had large popularity due to users having to buy 4G specific phones compared to phones that could easily switch from cellular generations in the past.<sup>21</sup> 4G networks featured networks that were up to 500 times faster than 3G.<sup>22</sup> 4G can support up to 2 Gbps and is slowly continuing to improve in speeds to this day.

The invention of 4G led creators to look ahead to the next generation of cellular networks: 5G. 5G was initially launched by South Korea in March 2019. The fifthgeneration network was rolled out by three South Korean telecom providers.<sup>23</sup> 5G brings three new aspects to the table: bigger channels (to speed up data), lower latency (to be

more responsive), and the ability to connect a lot more devices at once (for sensors and smart devices).<sup>24</sup> However, 5G networks are very much still a work in progress as many countries do not have the necessary capabilities and cell towers to effectively run 5G devices at their full force.

While generations 1-4 provided their own new networks and new cellular devices, 5G does not because it is not a network. 5G is not inherently separate from 4G. 5G phones all need 4G’s networks and coverage. Initially, all 5G networks used 4G to establish their connections, something called “non-standalone.” Now, “standalone” networks are being created, but there's no standard for voice calls over 5G yet. Therefore, every time you want to make a phone call, your phone has to fall back to 4G. Part of the 5G specifications also allows 5G phones to combine 5G and 4G channels invisibly and seamlessly to the user.” That symbiosis between 4G and 5G has caused AT&T to get a little overenthusiastic about its 4G network. “The carrier has started to call its 4G network "5G Evolution," because it sees improving 4G as a major step to 5G. AT&T is right to see it as an evolution, but the phrasing confuses less-informed consumers, making them think 5G Evolution is 5G, when it isn't.”<sup>25</sup> This means in part that while the US carriers will turn off their 2G and 3G networks in the next few years, 4G has many years ahead of it as part of the 5G equation.

In summation, “1G, the first generation of telecom networks (1979), lets us talk to each other and be mobile. 2G digital networks (1991) let us send messages and travel (with roaming services) 2.5G and 2.75G brought some improvement to data services (GPRS and EDGE). 3G (1998) brought a better mobile internet experience (with limited

success). 3.5G brought a truly mobile internet experience, unleashing the mobile apps eco-system. 4G (2008) networks brought all-IP services (Voice and Data), a fastbroadband internet experience, with unified networks architectures and protocols. 4G LTE ( for Long Term Evolution), starting in 2009, doubled data speeds. 5G networks will expand broadband wireless services beyond mobile internet to IoT and critical communications segments,” by allowing the creation of new industries and technologically advanced infrastructure.<sup>26</sup>

### III. Improvement on Current Technology 
The advancements in generational networks, as discussed in the previous section shows that 5G will provide many upgrades to the previous generations of wireless networks. These advancements will include some basic upgrades such as increased data speed on cell phones to advancements that are more complicated such as the Internet of Things (IoT). “5G for consumers means not just faster mobile internet, but mainly internet connectivity in many more objects than what you see today. The car and the house are two examples of the big IoT revolution coming ahead, supported by 5G networks.”<sup>27</sup> This section will provide an overview of the advancements that 5G will bring forth the both for the users of 5G products and the producers of these products. These advancements will be in the fields of smart devices, consumer products, industrial production, health care, and IoT connectivity. These advancements further display the

importance of 5G for countries and companies seeking to stay relevant in both global relations and business for generations to come.

The first advancement that will be noticeable around the globe is the utilization of 5G transmitter signals compared to 4G cell towers. While 4G LTE provides the foundation for 5G networks, they utilize “large, high-power cell towers to radiate signals over longer distances.” In contrast, 5G signals will be “transmitted through large numbers of small cell stations located in places like light poles or building roofs.”<sup>28</sup> The use of smaller cell stations instead of larger cell towers is called network densification. Cell phone carriers are already building hundreds of thousands of these “small cell” carriers all across the globe to supplement their 4G towers. The reason that 5G networks will use smaller stations located on preexisting or new places is due to an effort by companies to relieve network congestion that is often experienced when using 4G towers. “Sharing a 4G tower with everyone in your neighborhood means that sometimes networks falter and YouTube videos, games, or video chats stutter. 5G will first be deployed in urban neighborhoods to relieve areas with the most intense network congestion.”<sup>29</sup>

Another advancement that has been widely discussed is the major increase in speed that will occur in fully-functioning 5G networks compared to 4G LTE. “5G download speeds can currently reach upwards of 1,000 megabits per second (Mbps) or even up to 2.1 Gbps. To visualize this, a user could start a YouTube video in 1080p quality on a 5G device without it buffering. Downloading an app or an episode of a Netflix show, which may currently take up to a few minutes, can be completed in just a few seconds.

Wirelessly streaming video in 4K also becomes much more viable.”<sup>30</sup> These new speeds, while an advancement unto themselves, will lead to further advancements that will integrate technology more into our daily lives and every application that we touch. 

5G is much more than just fast downloads; its unique combination of high-speed connectivity, very low latency, and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars, trucks, and buses, where a split-second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4-way crash at an intersection.<sup>31</sup> 4G created a massive market for smartphone apps and the use of phones other than calling or texting such as mobile gaming, video watching, and ride sharing.<sup>32</sup> 5G improvements means more services and, with that, high-speed services. An example of a service is “Aira makes “smart glasses” for blind people. These glasses require wireless reliability and real-time responsiveness. A camera in the glasses streams video via a wireless connection to a distant human assistant who verbally helps the customer navigate airports, restaurants, and other public places.” <sup>33</sup>

5G networks will allow these advancements through the use of the IoT that was briefly discussed in this paper. Current devices which come to mind for many people include Alexa or Google home, but this will soon expand into many more home devices, wearable devices, and others. 5G will also bring about advancements in the business sector as companies will be able to use more artificial intelligence and advanced technology within their businesses. “Carriers and chip companies designed 5G standards

with enterprise and industry customers as a priority. Some enterprise services that might benefit from 5G include commercial drones (inspections, medicine delivery, Amazon deliveries, search and-rescue, etc.), air taxis and flying cars, remote control of autonomous vehicles, and warehouse floor robots.<sup>34</sup> 5G will enable us to control devices remotely where real-time network performance is critical, such as remote control of heavy machinery in hazardous environments, thereby improving worker safety, and even remote surgery. For example, a significant majority of healthcare executives surveyed (73%) expect next-generation mobile networks (5G) to allow them to implement new services and products that will improve quality of life for the general public. 5G promises to make remote medical care a reality—and to be a change agent for the future of the industry.<sup>35</sup>

With 5G, the continuous data exchange between machines, systems, robots and people will become an integral part of industrial production. The number of connected devices and parts will increase enormously. For example, the control units of industrial robots are addressed in real time – and error probabilities are ultimately reducible to a minimum. For example, the driverless courier service would therefore be able to always pick up the materials on time at the loading and unloading points of the machines. There are numerous examples in the industry to show how 5G can be used to optimize operational processes. The new technologies give rise to opportunities and ideas that nobody had thought of, because they were not technically possible before.<sup>36</sup> These ideas

and opportunities are also adapting to other economic sectors, regardless of industry. For example, agriculture with so-called smart farming. Thanks to digital use, data and insights regarding animal health, where weeds or pests are, or what the moisture in the soil is like are all possible. Such intelligent networks will multiply and mature in the future. With 5G IoT connectivity, smart farming creates something that conventional agriculture has not yet been able to do: It creates a greater degree of ecology while increasing efficiency in food production.<sup>37</sup>

More in depth, the IoT is going to be an integral part of almost everything that we buy within the next 10 years. It is evident that 5G is going to spur innovation across all industries and provides platforms for many emerging technologies. Connectivity is the heart of the 5G movement. With connectivity, the world will be a more efficient place. Operators have excelled in connecting phones, tablets, and other devices, but connecting and managing growing numbers of cars, meters, machinery sensors and consumer electronics profitably will require innovative business models.38 The IoT has the potential to provide users with smart services, while raising security and privacy questions and offering new challenges to standardization and governance bodies. The 5G technology can significantly expand IoT beyond what is possible with existing technologies. The 5G wireless network will enable IoT devices to interact with smart environment to a new level through intelligent sensors connected. The 5G wireless network can also significantly enlarge the scope and scale of IoT by providing the fastest communication
