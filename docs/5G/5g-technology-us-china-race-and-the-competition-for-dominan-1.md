## Chapter 1: Introduction
In 2021, 5G networks are commonly discussed. Whether on TV or a bill-board, people in the United States have seen or heard about 5G in some capacity. However, many people know 5G as a technology that will increase the speed of their phones, but they do not know the true capabilities that 5G networks and the untapped potential of this technology.

Wireless and computation technology advances quickly. As a result, approximately once a decade, cellular carriers, chipset makers, and technology companies come together to announce new wireless standards that take advantage of those innovations. 5G, as the name suggests, is the fifth generation of wireless standards. Most people in the United States with a smartphone are using 4G (also called Long Term Evolution or LTE) and 3G. As you might expect, 5G standards require operators to meet higher capabilities.<sup>1</sup> However, unlike previous generations, 5G will not completely replace 4G networks. Rather, it will compliment 4G, improving upon and adding further advancements to the fourth-generation technology.<sup>2</sup> While this new technology promises advancements for the future, it also will be the key in determining global dominance for the foreseeable future.

In April 2019, President Trump announced, “The race for 5G is on, and America

must win.”<sup>3</sup> One year later on March 23, 2020, President Trump signed the Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2020 which details the President’s plan “to take control and develop an implementation plan and security strategy for US 5G and other next generation telecommunications systems and infrastructure.”<sup>4</sup> This is a large step for the United States, who has largely tried to let companies compete for the creation of the popular, and somewhat misrepresented 5G network. However, the Chinese company Huawei holds the largest share of the 5G market and is ahead of most companies in the world. Due to this, the United States has felt increased pressure to become more of a player in the so called “Race for 5G” to attempt to block Huawei’s efforts to be far-ahead in technological advancement and 5G implementation.

The goal of this thesis is to assess why 5G technology is the key to winning the race between the United States and China for world dominance. Throughout this paper, I will seek to explore the ways in which the U.S.- China “race for 5G” will impact these countries on both a policy level and security level. I will also address the key factors which play into the race to 5G, with the most notable of these being the economic and cyber-based advantages that come with the first full implementation of this technology. I will explain how 5G technology will impact the future of the world through allowing the creation of more advanced infrastructure and the integration of data into all sectors of life with the Internet of Things. I will argue that China will win the race for 5G dominance because of unified Chinese country goals, government funding by the CCP, and Huawei’s

ability to grow more rapidly than their main competitors of Qualcomm and Ericcson. The review of the literature will provide background and lay the foundation for explaining how China will be the first country to fully implement 5G networks. In short, I will argue that 5G networks are the key to being the world superpower for the foreseeable future.

Prior to addressing these questions, it is vital that one understands the origins of 5G networks, the state of 5G networks in China as well as the U.S. and Europe, and the relations between the United States and China. Understanding these fundamental principles provides the knowledge necessary to make accurate analytical predictions. It also gives insight into the possible affects that 5G technological implementation will have on the relations between the United States and China as well as their competition for dominance.
