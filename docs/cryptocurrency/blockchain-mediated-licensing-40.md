## 4 Music Licensing Primer
Music licensing is an extremely important tool for musicians and copyright owners ( rightsholder ) to exploit the marketability of a musical work. As only authors and rightsholders may exploit a musical work, any third party that intends to use the copyrighted work for a purpose that falls under 17 U.S.C. § 106<sup>721</sup>will need to obtain a license from rights holders to use the work.<sup>722</sup> For example, if a TV show wanted to play a certain sound recording in an episode, the company producing the TV show would need to obtain a synchronization license from the rightsholder(s) to perform the sound recording in the episode.<sup>723</sup> In discussing the background on our research topic, we also decided to include a primer on music licensing to provide basic information on:

- Types of music licenses;

- Approaches to licensing;

- Territorially-restrictive licensing; and

- Licensing costs and issues.

Though music licensing is an important tool for rightsholders to exploit their music, it is also very difficult for rightsholders (licensors) and users (licensees) because of a lack of coordination and information.<sup>724</sup> Rights holders are unlikely to have the resources to track down every use of their music, and intended users may not understand how, when, and who to contact about licensing.<sup>725</sup> This is where collective management organizations (CMOs), such as the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), the Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers of Music (SACEM), and the Harry Fox Agency, become particularly important.<sup>726</sup> CMOs play the role of intermediary between the rightsholder and user, ensuring that licenses are being followed while collecting and distributing royalties to rightsholders.<sup>727</sup>

##### 4.1 Music License Typology

The most common types of music licenses are:

- mechanical,

- synchronization,

- public performance, and

- print.<sup>728</sup>

Mechanical licenses are licenses from the copyright owner for the right to reproduce and distribute a musical work in a recording (e.g., CDs, tapes, digital con gurations).<sup>729</sup> Synchronization licenses are licenses from the copyright owner for the right to synchronize the performance of a musical work with visual images.<sup>730</sup> Public

performance licenses are licenses from the copyright owner for the right to perform the musical work in public settings.<sup>731</sup> Print licenses are licenses from the copyright owner for the right to print their musical composition in a print format such as sheet music, folio or collection.<sup>732</sup>

### 4.2 Licensing Approaches
In the music industry, there are two general licensing approaches:

1. licensing on a collective basis (collective licensing), and

1.  licensing on an individual basis (individual licensing)<sup>733</sup> <sup>734</sup>

Collective licensing is the most popular form of licensing, wherein musicians will give certain rights to their works to a collective management organization (CMO), that will negotiate licensing fees, collect & distribute royalties, and monitor use of copyrighted works on the rightsholder's behalf.<sup>735</sup> The most popular CMOs for performance royalties are ASCAP, SACEM, and PRS for Music.<sup>736</sup> In addition to CMOs for performance royalties, there are also CMOs for mechanical royalties, such as the Harry Fox Agency.<sup>737</sup> In contrast to collective licensing, individual licensing is when rightsholders directly negotiate with users on the terms of use for their music.<sup>738</sup>

Collective licensing is the dominant approach because CMOs enable markets where rightsholder cannot directly interact with users, which is generally the case in the music industry.<sup>739</sup> CMOs play such a prominent role in music licensing because they reduce the administrative costs associated with the complexity of licensing copyrighted works.<sup>740</sup> The administrative costs for rightsholders are:

- negotiating license fees,

- collecting royalties,

- stopping infringements, and

- monitoring use of copyrighted works among multiple and different types of users.<sup>741</sup>

While the administrative costs for users are:

- identifying rightsholders, and

- avoiding conflict with rightsholders.<sup>742</sup>

CMOs provide economies of scale for the administrative costs of rightsholders and users when the two following conditions are met:

1. licensees are identical, i.e., the same information needs to be investigated for each licensee; and

1. when average costs fall as the number of works increases indefinitely.<sup>743</sup>

#### 4.2.1 Blanket Licensing Model
The primary licensing model employed by CMOs is a blanket license.<sup>744</sup> A blanket license is a license that  bundl[es] the entire repertoire  and then charges users a price depending on the  intensity of their use. <sup>745</sup> Blanket licensing is administratively e cient because it  spares market participants the costs of negotiating the exact size of the bundle of rights and its price for every transaction. <sup>746</sup>

Ruth Towse identi ed the main di erences between transactional licensing and blanket licensing in *The Economic E ects of Digitization on the Administration of Musical Copyrights*. In transactional licensing, every transaction is itemized and valued, which gives greater transparency and clearer market signals that users are interested in the work.<sup>747</sup> In blanket licensing, the user pays set rates for the whole repertoire and revenue is distributed to members based on the quantity of a work's (within their repertoire) usage.<sup>748</sup>

#### 4.2.2 Compulsory Licensing Model
Under the US Copyright Act of 1976 and amendments thereto, compulsory licenses are pre-negotiated, statutorily created licenses that allow specific uses of a copyrighted work if certain conditions are met, without the permission of the rightsholder.<sup>749</sup> Statutory exemptions to rights under copyright in 17 U.S.C. § 106 can be found in multiple sections in the U.S. Copyright Act, including 17 U.S.C.  110, 112, 114, and 115. For example, under Section 115 of the US Copyright Act, after a songwriter has released the first sound recording of their song, a compulsory mechanical license is automatically granted for subsequent sound recordings, thus allowing for the creation of cover songs.<sup>750</sup>

Under Sections 112 and 114, an organization may obtain a compulsory license to digitally transmit a sound recording to the public,  under the limitation on exclusive rights specified by Section 114(d)(1)(C)(iv) or under a statutory license in accordance with Section 114(f). <sup>751</sup> Under Section 112, an organization may obtain a compulsory license to make one ephemeral recording (i.e., make and keep a copy of the sound recording) of a sound recording, if a Section 114 compulsory license has been met.<sup>752</sup>

To obtain a compulsory license, a user needs to  (1) serve a timely Notice of Intention to Obtain a Compulsory License (NOI), either on the copyright owner or on the Copyright Office if the identity or address of the copyright owner is unknown; and (2) when the copyright owner is known, make monthly royalty payments and provide monthly statements of account to the copyright owner. <sup>753</sup> The traditional NOI for compulsory mechanical licensing was recently amended with the passage of the Music Modernization Act (MMA).<sup>754</sup>

#### 4.2.3 Creative Commons Licensing Model
Creative Commons (CC) licenses are a suite of public copyright licenses developed by the Creative Commons, a U.S. nonprofit, that are geared towards rightsholders who desire to make their works accessible, easily distributed, and usable by members of the general public.<sup>755</sup> CC licenses are generally applicable to any copyrighted work, but

are preferred for creative works (art, books, etc.), and are drafted to be amenable to any copyright framework.<sup>756</sup> CC licenses can be commercial or noncommercial, and generally deal with three types of permissions:

1. attribution,

1. adaption, and

1. redistribution.<sup>757</sup>

CC licenses present advantages for those who want to make their works accessible to the public because CC licenses, specifically the CC Attribution-ShareAlike license, offers the option of controlling future licensees down the road to the same terms as the original licensee for derivative works.<sup>758</sup>

The current CC license suite is comprised of six licenses, with varying degrees of openness:

- Attribution (CC BY),

- Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA),

- Attribution No-Derivs (CC BY-ND),

- Attribution Non-commercial (CC BY-NC),

- Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA), and

- Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND).<sup>759</sup>

Attribution (BY) requires that licensees credit the licensor for all uses of the copyrighted work.<sup>760</sup>ShareAlike (SA) requires that the licensees distribute derivative works under identical terms to the license governing the copyrighted work.<sup>761</sup> Non-commercial (NC) requires that licensees do not use the copyrighted work for any non-commercial purposes.<sup>762</sup> NoDerivs (ND) requires that the licensee does not make a derivative work from the copyrighted work.<sup>763</sup>

CC licenses are comprised of three layers:

1. legal code,

1. human readable, and

1. machine readable .<sup>764</sup>

The legal code is the traditional legal language involved in licensing.<sup>765</sup> The human readable layer is a summary of the legal code intended for non-legal audiences.<sup>766</sup> The machine readable code is a summary of the legal code formatted for software (primarily web services) to know that a work is licensed under a CC license under the standardized CC Rights Expression Language (ccREL).<sup>767</sup> ccREL is a means of expressing copyright licensing metadata based on the WorldWideWeb Consortium's (W3C) resource description framework (RDF) and eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and can be embedded in various  le types.<sup>768</sup>

### 4.3 Territorially-restrictive Licensing
Neil Conley in *The Future of Licensing Music Online: The Role of Collective Rights Organizations and the Effect of Territoriality* discussed the inefficiencies of CMO reciprocal agreements that include territorially-restrictive clauses, stating that such licenses are inefficient in an online music marketplace because transactions over the internet are inherently cross-border.<sup>769</sup>

CMOs enter into reciprocal agreements with foreign CMOs to collect royalties, and distribute their repertoire, on the CMO's behalf in the foreign CMOs territory.<sup>770</sup> Additionally, Conley highlighted four major issues with territorially-restrictive licenses imposed by CMOs<sup>771</sup> that lead to inefficiencies, summarized in the list below:

- online music providers can infringe CMO's reciprocal agreement with a foreign CMO by foreign users accessing music in a foreign territory subject to the foreign CMOs control;

- online music providers can infringe copyright holder's public performance right in a foreign jurisdiction by allowing a foreign person access to the music in the foreign jurisdiction without obtaining permission from the copyright holder to perform songs in the foreign jurisdiction;

- online music provider infringes foreign CMO right to collect royalties and distribute repertoire in foreign jurisdiction on behalf of native CMO; and

- online music provider breaches their blanket license with CMO when music is accessed in a foreign territory.<sup>772</sup>

Conley proposed many reasons why territorially-restrictive clauses remain in reciprocal agreements, in particular, that CMOs receive a large portion of their revenue from licensing their repertoire, and charge administrative fees<sup>773</sup>.

### 4.4 Licensing Costs and Issues
For our research topic, we organized the licensing costs and issues into four categories, some of which were described in the Literature Review.<sup>774</sup> The four categories of issues are:

1. transactional costs,

1. membership costs,

1. multi-territorial issues, and

1. contract management issues.

The first category of issues can be categorized as transactional costs. Transactional costs identified by Bodo et al. were:

- "identifying and matching rights holders and users,

- the high costs of monitoring use,

- the costs of enforcement, and

- the complexities of setting the price and negotiating the terms of use."<sup>775</sup>

Ex ante transaction costs (costs before a transaction is concluded) identified by KEA for online music service providers includes:

- "[i]dentification costs, which correspond to all the costs incurred to identify and find the rights owners"; and

- [n]egotiation costs, which correspond to all the costs incurred between identification and the actual agreement."<sup>776</sup>

Ex post transaction costs (costs after a transaction is concluded) identied by KEA for online music service providers include identifying repertoire and uses for reporting and invoicing purposes.<sup>777</sup>

The second category of issues can be categorized as collective management organization (CMO) issues, which we define as membership costs. Handke and Towse identified the three following membership costs:

1. membership fee,

1. revenue distribution, and

1. few if any alternatives to joining a CMO.<sup>778</sup>

The third category of issues can be categorized as multi-territorial issues. Multi-territorial issues include:

- multiple copyright frameworks, and

- territorially-restrictive licenses in a digital market context.<sup>779</sup>

The fourth category of issues can be categorized as contract management issues. Contract management issues include:

- how contracts should be stored and audited;

- parties not fulfilling obligations under the agreement;

- poor communication between the parties;

- hidden risks in a contract; and

- hard to find the important information in the contract.<sup>780</sup>
