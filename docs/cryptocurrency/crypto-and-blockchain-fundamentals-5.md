## V. New Fundraising Models
*“A major reason attributed to the success of fundraising through token offerings is the liquidity provided through the reduced trading friction enabled through the blockchain.” *— Jonathan Chester, Founder & President of Bitwage<sup>169</sup>

Nakamoto launched Bitcoin without raising funds.<sup>170</sup> Other proposed blockchain projects, however, sought to raise funds using new financing mechanisms such as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), Security Token Offerings (STOs), and Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs).<sup>171</sup>

### A. Initial Coin Offerings
With an ICO, people exchange money (typically bitcoins) for new coins released by the project’s founders.<sup>172</sup> ***Mastercoin*** was the first ICO, which raised $5.5 million in 2014.<sup>173</sup> Ethereum was the second ICO, raising $16 million in 2014.<sup>174</sup> With an ICO, projects raise cash by launching a new coin or token, i.e., a new cryptocurrency.<sup>175</sup> Investors buy the coins (but not shares in a company)—which bypassed many onerous regulations until regulators like the SEC finally investigated their legality.<sup>176</sup> ICOs raised about $14 billion dollars from 2014 to 2018.<sup>177</sup> However, when regulators around the world started intervening, the market fell precipitously.<sup>178</sup> In 2018, ICOs raised $7.8 billion worldwide compared to $370 million in 2019.<sup>179</sup> While ICOs fell in popularity, two new funding models rose in popularity: STOs and IEOs.<sup>180</sup>

### B. Security Token Offerings
***STOs*** are legally compliant, licensed ICOs which protect investors against fraud.<sup>181</sup> The value of the token is based on the company’s valuation.<sup>182</sup> STOs are only available for accredited investors.<sup>183</sup> In 2018, 119 security tokens were launched by capital investor firms, raising over $17 billion, with the majority

of that in the last quarter of the year.<sup>184</sup> A number of STO standards are emerging, which will make it easier for investors to liquidate.<sup>185</sup>

### C. Initial Exchange Offerings
***IEOs*** are a funding round conducted on a cryptocurrency exchange. Investors fund their exchange wallets with coins and use those funds to buy the fundraising company’s tokens.<sup>186</sup> Many exchanges now comply with AML and KYC regulations on customers and also vet the fundraisers, making IEO investments less risky than ICOs.<sup>187</sup> Binance, Huobi, OKEX, KuCoin, and BitMax are examples of exchanges with IEO services.<sup>188</sup>
