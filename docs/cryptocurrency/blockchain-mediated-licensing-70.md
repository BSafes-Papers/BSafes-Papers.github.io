## 7 Decentralized Media Platforms
In addition to our Literature Review<sup>874</sup>, we also reviewed the Terms of Service (ToS) of six decentralized media platforms<sup>875</sup> to determine how they are assisting musicians and creatives<sup>876</sup> in licensing their works on their platforms. The list of decentralized streaming platforms we considered for our analysis were:

1. Musicoin,

1. Resonate,

1. Choon,<sup>877</sup>

1. Creativechain,

1. LBRY, and

1. Ujo Music.

We chose the six above platforms for ToS review for two reasons. First, we could easily  nd their ToS or similar documents. Second, these platforms are prominent decentralized media platforms in the blockchain ecosystem. For the sake of brevity, we evaluated these six platforms to answer three questions:

1. What are the licensing options available to creatives?

1. How are the platforms abating transaction costs? and

1. What are the new costs arising from using decentralized media platforms?

From evaluating the six above platforms, and after reviewing *Overview of Licensing Platforms based on Distributed Ledger Technology*, we came to the conclusion further described in the Need for Greater Licensing Options section that there is a need for greater licensing options for creatives on decentralized media platforms (especially for an automated license (preferably a RC) that is interactive with Web3 technologies).<sup>878</sup> For another analysis of licensing on distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms, please refer to *Overview of Licensing Platforms based on Distributed Ledger Technology. <sup>879</sup>*

### 7.1 Musicoin
Musicoin is a decentralized, advertisement-free streaming platform  launched on the 11th of February 2017 when the genesis block of the Musicoin blockchain was mined. <sup>880</sup> Musicoin's blockchain is a fork of the Ethereum blockchain,  with network nodes and protocols con gured as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), capable of executing smart contracts in a Turing-complete language. <sup>881</sup> Musicoin incentivizes musicians to upload their music on the free streaming platform through their Pay-Per-Play (PPP) model, where musicians receive a certain amount of $MUSIC, the native cryptocurrency on the Musicoin blockchain, for each play of their music, from an artist Universal Basic Income (UBI) pool.<sup>882</sup>

The Musicoin Foundation's (MCF) Terms of Service and Artist Policy describe the legal relationship between the Foundation, musicians and users regarding intellectual property on the platform.<sup>883</sup> For musicians on the platform, the only license they can o er to other users is the PPP protocol (though, musicians may choose a di erent payment scheme than the PPP model) .<sup>884</sup> Musicians can license their works for streaming under the PPP protocol by uploading a musical work to the platform, and in the smart contract, placing their address in the recipient  eld.<sup>885</sup> Additionally, musicians can have their licenses interact with other licenses via the PPP smart contract, thus allowing for musicians to collaborate with each other, and enforce their negotiated terms via the PPP smart contract.<sup>886</sup>

The PPP protocol is a license between Musicians and MCF, in which musicians grant MCF the right to  perform tracks using the Service  in exchange for payment in $MUSIC.<sup>887</sup> MCF provides musicians a Musicoin wallet  following veri cation of the [Musician's] identity. <sup>888</sup> Musicians  receive $MUSIC per stream of each track at the rate identi ed in the PPP license and according to the percentages submitted to the Service. <sup>889</sup> Musicians are required to acknowledge  that they will accurately submit the PPP terms to allow for compensation of rights to Artist Content including tracks and agrees that Artist shall be responsible for any incurred costs of MCF due to any failure to assign, report or submit percentages for payments in accordance with our Agreement. <sup>890</sup> The royalty rate is determined by each stream of the track on the Musicoin platform and the percentages the Musician submits to MCF<sup>891</sup> Lastly, In the event Musician is in default of payment obligations, Musicoin may notify interested third parties if the default is not cured after receiving a noti cation of such.<sup>892</sup>

### 7.2 Resonate
Resonate is a multi-stakeholder platform cooperative that o ers an advertisement-free streaming service under the stream2own model.<sup>893</sup> Currently, Resonate is in the beta-stage of developing their streaming service.<sup>894</sup> In the stream2own model, the cost of a digital download is broken into nine separate streams, with the price increasing after every play until the ninth and  nal play, upon which the listener may stream the music for free or download a copy of the music .<sup>895</sup> On Resonate's streaming platform, musicians are known as Music Maker members, and are subject to the ToS for the streaming platform.<sup>896</sup> The ToS describe how Music Makers license their intellectual property to Resonate and Music Listener members.<sup>897</sup> Similar to Musicoin, the only licensing option available for musicians on Resonate is a license in accordance with the stream2own model..<sup>898</sup>

### 7.3 Choon
Choon is an advertisement-free streaming service built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.<sup>899</sup> Choon's streaming model operates similarly to Musicoin's PPP model, in that musicians who upload their music to the platform receive payment in $NOTES on a  pro-rata basis on the number of streams of their [music]. .<sup>900</sup> Additionally, musicians can share revenue with other users who curate their music into playlists.<sup>901</sup>Choon describes the licenses it grants to registered (a user who has created an account with Choon) and unregistered (a user who has not created an account with Choon) users in using the platform, the licenses registered users grant to Choon, and the license registered users grant to other users (registered and unregistered) and a liated platforms and services.<sup>902</sup> From analyzing Choon's ToS, it appears that a musician could o er multiple licenses (e.g., mechanical, synchronization, public performance) to other users on Choon, but we did not see such functionality available on the service..<sup>903</sup>

### 7.4 Creativechain
Creativechain is a multimedia content blockchain platform, where content creators (specifically targeted towards artists who create digital works of art) are rewarded for creating and curating content via Creativechain's Proof-of-Creation algorithm.<sup>904</sup>Creators and viewers can interact with Creativechain's blockchain on Creary, a social network DApp where creators can share their creative works with their followers and receive rewards in the CREA cryptocurrency based on user votes.<sup>905</sup>

In Creary's ToS, Creativechain describes the intellectual property licensing relationship between users (creatives and consumers) and between creators and Creativechain.<sup>906</sup> In particular, Creary's ToS differs from the other five (excluding LBRY) platform's ToS considerably because Crea does not store user uploads to their blockchain or centralized servers, instead uploads are stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and are accessible through Creary.<sup>907</sup> On Creary, creatives upload their works to the IPFS, and store the associated metadata (hash, name, URL, license, type, size, tags, and description) on the Creativechain blockchain. When uploading (i.e., publishing) a work, creatives are required to complete four steps in the publishing process:

1. Content;

1. Information;

1. Download; and

1. License.<sup>908</sup>

In Content, creatives present their project by combining different video or audio image files with text.909 In Information, creatives add basic information about the work.910 In Download, creatives choose whether to allow

users to download their work, and the price per download.<sup>911</sup> In License, creatives choose the licensing scheme for their work.<sup>912</sup>

Regarding authorship, Creary  automatically creates incorruptible timestamps that issue a certi cate of authorship and a distribution license for any digital work. <sup>913</sup> For creatives, this means that there is an uno cial certi cate of authorship that comes along with uploading works, which can provide some aid in tracing the origins of a work. Regarding distribution licenses, Creary o ers Creative Commons (CC) licenses when a creative is publishing their work to Creary.<sup>914</sup> However, we could not ascertain whether Creary will allow users to associate their own custom licenses with works uploaded to Creary, or the allowance of an automated licensing DApp on top of Creary that o ers di erent licensing schemes..<sup>915</sup>

Creatives on Creary can receive rewards from other users curating their content via voting, and by making their works available for purchase as a digital download.<sup>916</sup> For a work published and sold on Creary, creatives receive seventy-percent 70%) of the payment while curators receive thirty-percent (30%) of the payment..<sup>917</sup>

In Creativechain's multi-token economic system, there are three tokens:

1. CREA,

1. CREA Energy (CGY), and

1. CREA-based Dollar (CBD)<sup>918</sup>

CREA is the main cryptocurrency of the Creativechain blockchain, intended to be a liquid asset that operates like Bitcoin.<sup>919</sup> CGY and CBD derive their value from CREA.<sup>920</sup> CGY represents the power a user has when "voting for content or network witnesses (DPOS).".<sup>921</sup> The influence a user has on the payout of a work published onto Creary "is directly proportional to the amount of CGY they have."<sup>922</sup> CREA can be converted into CGY or exchanged for CBD.<sup>923</sup> CBD is intended to have a price correlation with the US Dollar (i.e., a Crea-based stablecoin).<sup>924</sup> CBD primarily tracks the price of CREA to USD (i.e., the price of converting X amount of units of CREA into 1 US Dollar)..<sup>925</sup> Users can withdraw CBD at any time. CBD can be exchanged for CREA through the CREA Core "tak[ing] and destroy[ing] the CBD and then creat[ing] new CREA."<sup>926</sup>

### 7.5 LBRY
LBRY is a multimedia content protocol for distributing and discovering media.<sup>927</sup> LBRY utilizes a BitTorrentlike protocol for  le sharing and hosting, a blockchain for tracking transactions, channels, and metadata associated with content, channels, and transactions, a DApp for users to interact with content, and a naming system for content so that users do not have to rely on a Content Identi er (CID).<sup>928</sup>

Creatives (specifically targeted towards YouTube-style content creators) are rewarded for uploading content to LBRY at a set price in either LBRY Credits (LBC) or US Dollars (USD), or a creative can o er their content for free.<sup>929</sup> Creatives also have the option to associate a specific distribution license with their works regarding how other LBRY users interact with their content.<sup>930</sup>When a creative publishes a work on LBRY, the creative can choose the distribution license associated with their work, with LBRY setting defaults for Creative Commons (CC) international licenses, Public Domain, None, Copyrighted, and Other.<sup>931</sup> The Other option lets creatives associate a custom license with the work, which requires a description of the license and an accompanying URL.<sup>932</sup> Concerning None's relation to Public Domain and Copyrighted, we are unsure how None di ers from Public Domain or Copyrighted.<sup>933</sup> LBRY, like Creativechain, provides creatives  exibility regarding the distribution license associated with their works, but we were not able to ascertain whether LBRY has any DApps for automated licensing via RCs.<sup>934</sup>

### 7.6 Ujo Music
Ujo Music ("Ujo") is a music streaming and download service built on the Ethereum blockchain (in the beta stage).<sup>935</sup> Ujo promotes a direct fan-to-artist model where fans can purchase a stream of a musician's work or a digital download of a work, tip musicians in cryptocurrency or buy a musician's NFT badge to represent support for a musician (purchasing badges is a planned feature to be added to Ujo).<sup>936</sup>

Ujo stores all musical works on the Ethereum blockchain and ties the musical works to the musician's Ethereum public address (i.e., musical works uploaded to Ujo cannot be deleted).<sup>937</sup> Musicians are required to upload full albums to Ujo.<sup>938</sup> Creatives can be compensated in Ether (ETH) or DAI for streams or downloads of their musical works.939 Currently, the streaming rate is one cent per play.<sup>940</sup>

In Ujo's ToS, users are granted  a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and make personal and non-commercial use of the Service [(The Site and any other features, tools, materials, or services offered from time to time by Ujo, including our smart contracts)]. <sup>941</sup> As such, users are only allowed to utilize Ujo's platform for personal and non-commercial use.<sup>942</sup> We did not  find anything specific in Ujo's ToS about licensing options available to musicians other than streaming and digital downloads.<sup>943</sup> Though, this may change if Ujo integrates OpenLaw and uPort into the platform.

### 7.7 The Wicked Costs of Decentralized Media Platforms

arise in complex systems<sup>945</sup> from the interaction of local parts that do not have a simple nor a single solution.<sup>946</sup> The complexity of the music industry gives rise to these wicked problems, and thus requiring solutions that affect the industry at multiple points to solve them.<sup>947</sup> If not addressed in a systematic approach, any one solution to a wicked problem will lead to new, additional problems that keep the status quo. As stated by Sellin and Seppälä and Torbensen and Ciriello in their analyses of the music industry, a solution(s) to address the complexity and inequities of the music industry needs to be systemic and incentivize stakeholders to align their interests with each other.<sup>948</sup> Here, in abating the licensing costs and issues of the music licensing process<sup>949</sup> and other issues in the music industry (though, not at a systemic level), these platforms also create a new host of costs that must be contended with and addressed by platform owners and users.<sup>950</sup>

The six decentralized media platforms aid in abating transaction costs, specifically monitoring, enforcement and negotiating costs, associated with licensing.<sup>951</sup> LBRY, Ujo, Musicoin, Choon, Creativechain and Resonate (when Resonate is out of beta) abate monitoring and enforcement costs because all transactions are tracked and made transparent on the blockchain, and all transactions are made via smart contracts which self-enforce the licensing model(s) for the platform. The above platforms also reduce negotiating costs because: 

- the price of a stream is predetermined by the licensing model on the platform; 

- the creative can associate a price with their work on the platform; or 

- the creative work is offered for free on the platform. 

However, the six above platforms, do not necessarily reduce identification costs because the platforms do not pre-verify whether the user who is uploading the work is the author or an appropriate rightsholder of the work.952 Though, this is not meant to diminish the efforts of Resonate, Ujo, and Musicoin to verify users on the platform, but pre-verifying users this does not necessarily prevent misattribution of authorship or copyright ownership in a work.<sup>539</sup> Besides abating licensing costs and issues associated with the traditional licensing process, the platforms also bring with them five new costs.<sup>954</sup> . 

The first cost is the volatility cost, which arises from the usage of cryptocurrencies and tokens (e.g., $MUSIC, $NOTES, $ETH) on these platforms. These cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and their market value can have major fluctuations on even a daily basis.<sup>955</sup> 

The second cost is the exit cost, which arises from converting the cryptocurrencies and tokens into other cryptocurrencies or  at currencies (i.e., leaving the platform's ecosystem).<sup>956</sup> The exit cost arises from creatives cementing or realizing the expected value garnered from these platforms. In other words, the creatives only know

the true value or remuneration of their work in the outside economy once they convert their cryptocurrencies or tokens (which are only local to the blockchain, and thus the blockchain's or network's local economy).<sup>957</sup>

The third cost is the technical issues cost, which arises from the inherent technical architecture of Web3 technologies (speci cally blockchain and smart contracts).<sup>958</sup> For example, blockchain's immutability feature can be an issue (and is a major issue for Ujo) because if a creative ever needs to remove their content for any reason, e.g., copyright infringement, it is nearly impossible to do so. Though, this can be mitigated against by making the content inaccessible on the platform or storing the content on a mutable data storage solution such as the IPFS.

The fourth cost is the network-industry cost, which arises from the need for network e ects and/or industry adoption for these platforms to gain a foothold. The network-industry cost can inhibit a platform's growth if the platform cannot garner enough users<sup>959</sup> for network e ects to kick in.<sup>960</sup> Additionally, if a platform cannot become adopted in the industry, it will be nigh impossible for the platform to incentivize all music industry stakeholders to share data with the platform, use the platform, and participate in the platform's governance.<sup>961</sup>

The  fifth cost is the e ective governance cost. For these platforms to survive and grow, especially in the face of uncertainty, they must have e ective governance models<sup>962</sup> For example, since most of these platform's (and the underlying software they utilize) have their software licensed under an open source license (and this is the norm for most Web3 technology projects), if a segment (or class of stakeholders) of the platform's community is no longer satis ed with the platform owner's maintenance of the platform, they can, at any time, fork the software and run their own version of the platform (i.e., a hard fork).<sup>963</sup> This can lead to loss of personnel, knowledge, software advances, and other resources that would otherwise have stayed with the platform.<sup>964</sup> To prevent a hard fork, a platform's owner(s) must satisfy the needs and concerns of the segments in the platform's community, including external and internal stakeholders.<sup>965</sup> This can be an issue for platforms that operate at the protocol layer (i.e., base layer or layer 1), and the application layer (i.e., layer 2 or DApp layer).<sup>966</sup>

<sup>959</sup>For example, a streaming platform would need both music listener users and music maker users. Though, a platform usually just needs to garner enough users on one side (e.g., listeners or makers) to incentivize the other side to join the platform.

Additionally, for platforms that operate on the application layer, they must be prescient and ready to participate in the governance processes at the protocol layer, lest they be blindsided by unexpected changes to the protocol's software.<sup>967</sup>

### 7.8 The Need for Greater Licensing Options
Based on our review of the ToS, copyright related policies, and other relevant policies governing the use of user-uploaded content onto decentralized media platforms, we came to the following three conclusions. First, the legal documentation for the platforms reviewed concerning user-uploaded music does not grant musicians as much autonomy as they may perceive or expect from using a decentralized media platform, often described as alternatives that put the control back into the hands of musicians. Second, other than Creativechain and LBRY, the decentralized media platforms did not o er creators the option of attaching a license to accompany their works other than those prescribed in the ToS. Third, the platforms that allow creatives to attach a license not prescribed in the ToS to their works, Creativechain and LBRY, only provided default options for CC licenses for distribution, which unfortunately, does not fully span the spectrum of licensing options available to, or desired by, creatives. With these conclusions in mind, we believe that there is a need for:

- further study in developing automated music licenses (and copyright licenses in general) that interact with Web3 technologies; and

- offering more licensing options to creatives than what is currently available on decentralized media platforms.
