## 2 Music Industry Supply Chain and Work Registration Standards
DDEX, formed in 2006 as the  Digital Data Exchange,  is a consortium of media-related companies developing digital supply chain standards for use among music industry stakeholders.<sup>576</sup> In 2008, DDEX developed and released its digital supply chain standard, a standardized eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format for transmitting information between parties (generally business-to-business).<sup>577</sup> DDEX's supply chain standard has been adopted all across the music industry ( digital retailers, digital distributors and aggregators, record companies, music rights societies and various technical service providers ), with  more than 3,500 implementation licences [] issued. <sup>578</sup> DDEX's supply chain standards generic enough so that it can be adapted to other digital supply chains.<sup>579</sup> DDEX offers an implementation license that allows the implementation of the DDEX supply chain standards via an application programming interface (API). <sup>580</sup> DDEX implements its standards similar to W3C, such that anyone may become a contributor to the standards by joining as a member, but differs from W3C in that its standards are not publicly available.<sup>581</sup>

The Common Works Registration (CWR) standard is a supply chain standard developed by performance rights organizations and music publishers, and maintained by the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (CISAC).<sup>582</sup> The CWR is a standard format, that provides the necessary data required for registering and revising works with performance rights organizations or mechanical rights organizations.<sup>583</sup> Additionally, the standard allows for tracking and facilitating the transfer of musical works  between publishers and societies. <sup>584</sup> CISAC also maintains the International Standard Work Code (ISWC) for musical works in ISO 15707.<sup>585</sup> ISWC is the international standard for identifying a musical work.<sup>586</sup> The minimum descriptive metadata required for a ISWC is:

- "the title of the work,

- all composers, authors and arrangers of the work identified by their IPI numbers and role codes,

- the work classification code (from the CIS standards list), [and]

- in the case of 'versions', for example arrangements, identification of the work from which the version was made."<sup>587</sup>

The International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is an international standard for identifying sound and music video recordings.<sup>588</sup> The ISRC is comprised of the following elements, in the following order:

- "Country Code",

- "Registrant Code",

- "Year of Reference", and

- "Designation Code."<sup>589</sup>

" The Country Code identifies the country of residence of the registrant." <sup>590</sup>  The Registrant Code identifies the entity assigning the Designation Code in an ISRC. <sup>591</sup>  The Year of Reference Element identifies the year in which the ISRC is allocated to the recording. <sup>592</sup>  The Designation Code consists of five digits assigned by the Registrant. <sup>593</sup>
 
 The International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) is an international standard for public identification of contributors to creative works.<sup>594</sup> A creative seeking an ISNI will have to contact an ISNI Registration Agency to obtain an ISNI from the ISNI International Agency.<sup>595</sup>
