## A. DOES CODE NEED LAW?

### 1. A GLOBAL TRANSFER MECHANISM WITHOUT A LEGAL BASIS
DLT is often presented as an alternative to legal solutions. It was originally designed to surmount the shortcomings of the trust-based banking system that gives banks and states a prominent role.<sup>16</sup> Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used in the original bitcoin proposal, saw these institutions as being inherently corrupt.<sup>17</sup> His goal was to eliminate the need for them by creating a peer-to-peer system in which transactions are recorded by a decentralized network of computers rather than intermediaries.<sup>18</sup>

The philosophical underpinnings of the blockchain stand in sharp tension to the rule of law. Anarchists, like “cypherpunks” and “crypto rebels,”<sup>19</sup> are attracted to DLT because they see autonomous cryptocurrencies as a safeguard of civil liberties against a Big Brother state.<sup>20</sup> The idea also appeals to neoliberals because it might toll the bell for the state’s monopoly to create money.<sup>21</sup> For both ends of the political spectrum, the right-wing and the left-wing, DLT is essential to reduce the role of the government and its rules.<sup>22</sup> The anti-legalistic tendency is epitomized in the formula “code is law,” which was coined by Lawrence Lessig, albeit with precisely the opposite intention: to demonstrate that the state should intervene in the internet’s architecture.<sup>23</sup> Some authors maintain that the blockchain

would be governed by a non-state and a-national law for the digital age, which they call *lex cryptographica.*<sup>24</sup>

A quick look at the technology seems to confirm the idea that code is indeed replacing the law: DLT permits to transfer assets on the internet without any intervention by banks or other intermediaries that can be controlled by the state.<sup>25</sup> A DLT transfer is initiated when the transferor enters a unique digital key that is only known to him (a “private key”) as well as the publicly known key of the transferee (a “public key”) to a chain of digital signatures on the internet.<sup>26</sup> The transfer is then broadcast via a unique “hash” (a string of numbers) to computer servers (so-called “nodes”), which verify the validity of the keys and the conformity to the previous transfers in the chain.<sup>27</sup> Each of the nodes maintains its own copy of all transfers (the “ledger”) against which it checks the new transfer.<sup>28</sup> The nodes work on a decentralized basis and are dispersed around the world (therefore “distributed ledger”).<sup>29</sup> The nodes are assigned a “fee” to incentivize them to perform the verification work.<sup>30</sup> Their verification effort results in the addition of a new block to the chain (therefore “blockchain”). Once it is proven that enough work has been invested into the verification process, the longest blockchain—representing the decision of the majority of nodes— will be accepted by all others.31 From this moment, the chain can no longer be altered without redoing all the verification work

that has been done, which becomes even more difficult as new blocks are added.<sup>32</sup>

This whole process is independent of any legal rules. The transfer comes about by the transferor combining its private key with the public key of the transferee and the following confirmation of the transfer through the verification process.<sup>33</sup> None of this requires the intervention of notaries, lawyers, or intermediaries that could be supervised, e.g. banks, clearing agents, or depositories.<sup>34</sup> Nor does it need a contract, or any other legal agreement or act. In this sense, the characterization of code as law seems to be entirely fitting.

### 2. PRIVATE LAW PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE FROM DLT TRANSFERS
Although many consider DLT as independent from the law or an underpinning legal system, they nevertheless seem to assume that the technology yields legally binding results. For instance, it is very often said that the recipient of a transfer becomes the “owner” of the bitcoin,<sup>35</sup> or that concepts such as “ownership” and “property” would also apply to cryptocurrencies.<sup>36</sup> Statements like these presuppose that DLT transfers have some effect on the level of property law. But it is wholly unclear whether bitcoin and other virtual currencies can indeed be conceptualized as property from the point of view of

ONLINE 22, 29 (2014) (calling direct ownership of bitcoin “a new class of private property”); Fairfield, *supra* note 3 at 842–54 (suggesting to reconceptualize property law as the “law of information” in order to cover virtual assets like cryptocurrencies).

the common law.<sup>37</sup> An even more problematic but often neglected point is that one cannot assume the blockchain is exclusively or predominantly subject to the common law.<sup>38</sup> Given the division of the world into different states with diverging legal systems, each and every form of property exists by virtue of its recognition under some applicable national law.<sup>39</sup> It is first necessary to identify this law through the mechanics of conflicts of law before it can be applied to any phenomenon of the real or virtual world.

To blockchain enthusiasts, the search for an applicable property law is anathema.<sup>40</sup> They consider DLT as guaranteeing the position of the acquirer with absolute certainty, something that a real-world transaction with tons of documentation, lawyers, and courts cannot provide.<sup>41</sup> From their point of view, the technology does not need law.<sup>42</sup>

Yet this belief is wrong. Blockchain is designed to avoid “double spending,” i.e. that the same owner transfers the bitcoin twice. It provides no safeguards at all against other problems

that may occur.<sup>43</sup> The following provides some illustrations of such problems. In order to get a better overview, they will be divided into those that are endogenous, i.e. inherent to the transaction, and those that are exogenous, i.e. rooted in events outside the blockchain.<sup>44</sup>

#### a) Endogenous Transfer Problems
Many problems inherent to the transaction may plague a DLT transfer. One of them is that the transferor may have made a mistake.<sup>45</sup> He might, for instance, have entered the wrong number of bitcoin, e.g. “10” instead of “1.” It is also conceivable that the transferor’s assent to the bitcoin transfer was induced by fraud or material misrepresentation because the transferee has made false allegations to induce the transferor to use its private key. Furthermore, it is possible that the transferor acted under the influence of an improper threat by the transferee, thereby forcing her to make the transfer. This is by no means a farfetched possibility, given that many online blackmailers today demand payment in bitcoin, e.g. in exchange for abstaining from the publication of private information on the internet.<sup>46</sup>

From a legal point of view, in all of these situations the contract that entails the property transfer is voidable.<sup>47</sup> Yet

under the blockchain, the transfer is effective.<sup>48</sup> For an effective transfer, it suffices that the correct codes have been used.<sup>49</sup> Transfers of bitcoins are recorded as long as the correct private key of the transferor is combined with an existing public key of a transferee.<sup>50</sup> The technology does not take into account mistakes, fraud, or improper threats.<sup>51</sup> These are not part of the algorithm.

Even worse, the cryptocurrency transfer is also effective where it is not supported by any agreement at all. This may occur where the transferor or the transferee has been subject to some strong form of incapacity, for instance, because they suffer from a mental illness or defect.<sup>52</sup> One must also not discard the possibility that the parties to the transfer have never been in contact.<sup>53</sup> For example, the transferor could have confused the public key of the transferee with that of another person. Or the transferee could hack the computer of the transferor, copy his private key, and used it to transfer to bitcoin to himself. In these cases, no contract has been concluded between both sides.<sup>54</sup> Yet from a technological point of view, the transfers would be effective.<sup>55</sup>

ownership of crypto assets.<sup>56</sup> One salient example is succession or inheritance law. In most legal systems, in case of death the assets of the decedent are vested in their entirety in the heirs or the executor of a will.<sup>57</sup> This transfer is automatic and not conditioned on any transmission of possession or other act. Arguably, it also includes any cryptocurrency that the decedent had acquired.<sup>58</sup> Since the decedent is no longer able to dispose of these coins, his successors must have become the “owners” outside of the DLT.<sup>59</sup> The question is how and under which national law does this transfer happen legally.

Exogenous problems may also occur in case of bankruptcy. Typically, the bankruptcy trustee steps into the shoes of the debtor and acquires the right to dispose of all of the latter’s assets in order to satisfy the creditors.<sup>60</sup> This power arguably extends to virtual assets, such as bitcoin, which can make up a

sizeable proportion of the debtor’s wealth. Furthermore, many legal systems endow the bankruptcy trustee with the power to avoid transactions made before the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings that favor particular creditors over others.<sup>61</sup> To achieve its goal of protecting the bankruptcy estate against fraudulent, biased, or suspect transfers by the debtor, this power must also extend to bitcoin and other virtual currency payments.<sup>62</sup> The treatment of cryptocurrencies in bankruptcy proceedings is the subject of intense legal discussion.<sup>63</sup> Independently of the correct characterization, it should be clear that crypto assets are part of the debtor’s estate and, as such, must be used for the benefit of his creditors.

### 3. INTERMEDIATE CONCLUSION
The problems discussed, whether they are endogenous or exogenous to the blockchain, affect the private relationships between individuals. They concern the parties to a bitcoin transfer, but also third parties such as the heirs or creditors of a holder of crypto assets. None of these issues are taken into account by the functioning of DLT. The blockchain largely ignores them. Real-life problems like mistake, duress, death, or bankruptcy are not solved by decentralizing a ledger in which transactions are recorded. In all of these cases, a rational outcome cannot be ensured without the intervention of the law.
