## B. CODE’S RESISTANCE TO THE LAW 
To solve the problems mentioned, one could simply try to apply the concepts, principles, and rules of private law to DLT. This would entail determining for each and every operation on the blockchain the applicable national law and checking whether its requirements for the transfer of property are fulfilled. Yet such a legalistic approach cannot overcome the gap between law and technology. There are several stumbling blocks that stand in its way.

### 1. THE AUTONOMY OF THE BLOCKCHAIN VIS-À-VIS NATIONAL LAW

The first obstacle on the road to applying the law to DLT is its autonomy. The technology operates independently from the law.<sup>64</sup> It is also impossible for the law to impose its requirements on the blockchain.<sup>65</sup>

The problem is well illustrated by the case of stolen bitcoin that a thief transfers to his own public key.<sup>66</sup> Legally, this transfer should be invalid given that the holder of the bitcoin has never agreed to it.<sup>67</sup> But when the correct codes are entered and broadcast to the nodes, a new private key is created for the recipient in about ten minutes, the average time to confirm a bitcoin transaction.<sup>68</sup> This private key gives the transferee the factual power to dispose of the crypto currency despite the fact that there was no legal basis for the transfer.<sup>69</sup> Though the

recipient cannot be considered the “owner” of the bitcoin in a legal sense, he has obtained the ability to transfer via the blockchain. It is impossible to prevent him from exercising this power by, for example, sending the bitcoin to a third party. Any transfer made by him leads to the creation of a new private key in the transferee’s favor, who can be anywhere on the planet. This new key can then be used again to create a further new private key for anybody in the world, and so on. The process is legally unstoppable.

Another illustration of the blockchain’s resistance to the law is the hypothetical of succession. Let us imagine “A,” dying intestate with his private key stored on an office computer to which his employer has exclusive access. Legally, all of A’s assets belong to his estate.<sup>70</sup> Yet factually, the employer has the private key in his possession, which gives her unlimited power to send the crypto currency to anybody she wants. The legitimate heir or executor of the will, in turn, is unable to dispose of the crypto asset as he lacks the private key. There is no way to obtain it other than via the blockchain. The technology resists accounting for the death of the bitcoin holder because the event takes place outside of the blockchain.

What emerges in these cases is that the divide between law and technology cannot be easily overcome. DLT is a selfcontained mechanism that works autonomously and is shielded from outside influences. A transfer of crypto assets is effective on the blockchain whenever the private and public keys are used, and only in this case. For this reason, the hacker who obtained bitcoins illegally can dispose of them, whereas an heir or executor who is legally entitled to them cannot. To make DLT compatible with the law would require a complete reconceptualization of the technology. This cannot be done under the protocol in its current form.

### 2. THE IRREVERSIBILITY OF BLOCKCHAIN TRANSFERS
One could attempt to avoid the clash between technology and the law by “correcting” the blockchain after a transfer is executed. Instead of requiring title or property as a condition of transfer, one might, for instance, consider the transfer made by the thief to himself in the example above as being invalid. As a

***

***

consequence, the newly added block of the chain would have to be deleted and the original owner and victim of the theft would have to be reinstated as the rightful holder of the bitcoin. The same procedure could be used where someone other than the heir of the bitcoin holder or the executor of his will disposes of his assets. In other words, the blockchain would be changed *subsequent* to the transfer in such a way as to restore the parties to their original positions.

Such a corrective approach would, however, be inhibited by another feature of the blockchain: its immutability or “nonrepudiability.”<sup>71</sup> Once a transfer has been added to the chain in the form of a block, the information can no longer be removed technologically. The chain has been transformed forever and can only be accepted by other nodes as such. Every transfer on the blockchain is, therefore, immutable, which is one of the major reasons why DLT is particularly tamper-proof and can dispense with trust.<sup>72</sup>

One must partially qualify the characterization of blockchain transfers as immutable. There are a great variety of DLT networks, which represent different trade-offs in terms of reversibility and finality of transactions.<sup>73</sup> They can be roughly divided into permissioned and permissionless networks.<sup>74</sup> Permissionless systems are those in which anybody can

participate and where consensus is thus highly distributed.<sup>75</sup> In contrast, permissioned systems feature one or more authorities that act as gatekeepers.<sup>76</sup> They allow participants into the network and sometimes also confirm transfers.<sup>77</sup> In a permissioned system of the latter type, i.e. one with confirmation powers limited to some nodes, it is relatively easy to reverse a transaction with the help of the authorities in charge.<sup>78</sup> Yet reversals are also not unthinkable in other types of permissioned and even in permissionless systems.<sup>79</sup> They are effectuated by creating a so-called hard fork that splits the blockchain protocol in two. This happened, for example, to the Bitcoin network when it was reorganized in 2013,<sup>80</sup> and with the Ethereum network after a considerable amount of the cryptocurrency was siphoned off by hackers in 2016.<sup>81</sup> In both instances, a new version of the blockchain was created. While the case of Bitcoin seems to have been relatively unproblematic, in the case of Ethereum, the old, hacked ledger refused to die, which resulted in the parallel existence of two separate currencies: Ethereum (One) and Ethereum Classic.<sup>82</sup>

The example of Ethereum illustrates that a reversal of the blockchain comes at a hefty price. Two parallel versions of the same ledger are far from ideal and may lead to many problems. Those who have invested in the “dying” ledger are deprived of the “real” cryptocurrency. All other participants will be confused

by the parallel existence of two versions of the same ledger.<sup>83</sup> Both effects undermine trust in the cryptocurrency. It is hard to overestimate the negative repercussions since the value of the cryptocurrency depends first and foremost on trust.<sup>84</sup> Therefore, a hard fork is not a viable option except for the most extreme and rare cases, such as the discovery of a major hack that corrupts a very large number of transfers. For all other purposes, undoing a DLT transfer is impracticable.

### 3. THE A-NATIONAL CHARACTER OF THE BLOCKCHAIN
Another problem that stands in the way of applying law to the blockchain is that before one could do so, it would first be necessary to determine *which* national law applies. The rules of private law are mainly made at the level of the state. Since the world is split into states with differing rules of private law, there is no such thing as a global law for private transactions. In order to assess any blockchain transfer in legal terms, one must, therefore, first determine the applicable national law. This is the task of conflict of laws, or “private international law” as it is called in many parts of the world.<sup>85</sup> Conflict of laws works by attributing sets of facts or “relations” to the law of the state with which it has the closest connection.<sup>86</sup> DLT presents a formidable challenge for this methodology.

The blockchain is a global or “transnational” transfer mechanism that has little to no connections with any particular state. Transfers are executed on the basis of private and public keys without determining the location of the parties.<sup>87</sup> The

protocols are stored on computers worldwide. Anybody can participate in permissionless systems like Bitcoin for there is no authority or server that controls access.<sup>88</sup> Confirmations take place through distributed consent from nodes all over the world.<sup>89</sup> It is thus not exaggerated to say that permissionless systems are completely de-nationalized and not connected to any particular country, which makes it impossible to determine the state with the closest connection.

A further problem is that most conflict-of-laws systems provide different rules for different types of relations. They distinguish between contracts, torts, property, and succession, to name but a few.<sup>90</sup> To fit the blockchain technology into of one of these categories is challenging, to say the least. On the one hand, there is clearly a transactional aspect to blockchain in the cases where the transfer is accompanied by an agreement between the transferor and the transferee.<sup>91</sup> On the other hand, a property law analysis may also seem apposite because the coins or other assets encrypted on the blockchain often have market value and can be assimilated to goods which are the object of property law.<sup>92</sup>

Let us consider for a moment the implications of one or the other qualification. A contractual qualification would lead to the principle of party autonomy, according to which the parties to a contract can freely select the law applying to their agreement.<sup>93</sup>

If followed strictly, this principle would allow the parties to choose the law applying to the transfer. As a result, a great variety of different laws would govern DLT. A different law could apply to each transfer recorded on the chain, depending on the choice made by the individual parties. This would be incompatible with the coherence of the chain. Also, the law that the transferor and the transferee have chosen would be unknown from the perspective of other participants, except where this choice had been coded into the blockchain, which is highly unusual and not easy from a technical point of view.

One could instead embed a central choice of law in the protocol of the cryptocurrency. The chosen law would then govern *all* transactions with the digital asset.<sup>94</sup> Yet it is very unlikely that such a choice of a national law would be made because it is contradictory to the explicit anti-legal philosophy underlying Bitcoin.<sup>95</sup> Such a choice is incompatible with the ideals of crypto aficionados,<sup>96</sup> and is therefore unlikely to be

made. Moreover, it would give a single state plenary power over the blockchain, which lends itself to abuse. Applying one national law exclusively may be appropriate for some permissioned systems that are backed up by one or several authorities sitting in a certain country, yet it seems inappropriate for permissionless systems that are open to the whole world and not connected to any particular state.

In case no law has been chosen, a contractual qualification would lead to the applicability of default conflicts rules. Many legal systems point to the law at the habitual residence of the party that is to perform the characteristic obligation as the law governing contracts in the absence of a choice.<sup>97</sup> But such a default rule would not work for the anonymous transfers on the blockchain, in which neither the identity nor the address of the transferor is known.

These difficulties in applying classic conflict rules for contracts point to a larger problem: These rules are designed for the exchange of goods or services between parties that know each other, not for pseudonymous transfers of crypto assets in a computer system. It is not even justified to assume that a DLT transfer is supported by an agreement, since it can also be the result of a mistake or coercion.<sup>98</sup> In this sense, a contract conflicts-of-laws analysis creates many issues that are insurmountable.

If one instead characterizes crypto transfers as property, the law that would normally apply is the lex rei sitae, which is the law of the state where the object of the property right—“the thing”—is located.<sup>99</sup> Such a locational exercise would be all but impossible for a virtual object stored in the blockchain. These objects “exist” only in the ledger that is distributed among numerous computers around the world. The simple truth is that a bitcoin has no geographical home and is impossible to locate.

There are, however, variations and adaptations of the *lex rei sitae* rule that one could attempt to follow. For instance, many states apply the so-called PRIMA rule for incorporeal securities, which refers to the law in force at the place of the relevant

intermediary.<sup>100</sup> This approach could be used, e.g., for permissioned systems without an explicit choice of law. One could submit them, e.g., to the law of the relevant operator, even though its role is not precisely the same as that of an intermediary administering “accounts” of securities.<sup>101</sup> But while such an approach may perhaps work for permissioned systems, it is not feasible in a permissionless environment, which gives no special status to any of the participants spread around the world. The PRIMA rule therefore does not fit blockchains such as those for Bitcoin.<sup>102</sup>

A third route between contract and property could be to use the conflict-of-laws rules for assignment. Assignment is a special technique whereby the assignor transfers a nonphysical claim to the transferee.<sup>103</sup> It is usually effectuated by a simple agreement between both parties. Once perfected, the transfer of the claim is effective against third parties, such as creditors of the transferor or competing transferors.<sup>104</sup>Hence, assignment can, to a certain extent, be assimilated to the transfer of property in intangible objects. The conflict-of-laws rules that apply to assignment are, however, notoriously uncertain and oscillate between different solutions, such as applying the law in force at the domicile of the transferor, the law governing the assignment, or the law underlying the claim.<sup>105</sup> Moreover, any analogy

between blockchain and assignment is bound to fail because the scope of application of the blockchain is much wider than that of assignment. Besides incorporeal claims, it can be used to transfer virtual assets, like cryptocurrencies, or intellectual property rights, e.g. copyrights in pictures. One can even employ DLT to transfer physical assets, whether movables or immovables, through tokenization.<sup>106</sup> These assets are very different from claims and call for different conflict rules.

In sum, none of the received conflict-of-laws solutions lends itself to DLT. This problem is fundamental because it stands in the way of developing new substantive rules that are specific to the blockchain. Proposals such as those to reconceptualize property law<sup>107</sup> or to recognize bitcoin as a new kind of property<sup>108</sup> are built on the implicit assumption that a certain national law governs the blockchain (often the common law). Yet they fail to address the primary question of how this law is determined, or which version of the common law they mean, and why it is this and not another national law that applies. A set of substantive rules that could eliminate conflicts issues and govern the blockchain as a whole would have to be global in scope. We are, however, far away from having such a law. In fact, it is nowhere in sight.
