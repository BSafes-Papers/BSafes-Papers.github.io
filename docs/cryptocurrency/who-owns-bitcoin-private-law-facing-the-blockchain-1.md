## INTRODUCTION 
By now, virtually everybody has heard about the blockchain, or “distributed ledger technology” (DLT), as it is called among professionals. Claims that DLT is about to change the world or trigger a new informational revolution may have been greatly exaggerated.<sup>1</sup> What the technology offers is a mechanism for the

transfer of assets between two parties at any place in the world with an internet connection.<sup>2</sup> Importantly, its use is not limited to the transfer of virtual currencies and other crypto assets, but can also extend—through so-called tokenization—to objects of the physical world, such as gold, land, or stocks.<sup>3</sup> The main advantage of DLT is that it dispenses with the necessity of trust between the parties and sharply reduces the need for intermediaries.<sup>4</sup> This is the result of three hallmark features of DLT: pseudonimity, resilience, and immutability.<sup>5</sup> Pseudonymity denotes that although each transfer is recorded on a ledger that is open to the public, the identity of the parties to the transfer is not revealed.<sup>6</sup> The resilience of DLT stems from the fact that the ledger is distributed over a large number of nodes that cannot be easily attacked at the same time.<sup>7</sup> Finally, immutability means that the transfers cannot be undone once they have been recorded on the blockchain.<sup>8</sup>

As is by now equally well-known, DLT raises a number of legal problems, such as the possibility of money laundering, drug and arms dealing, terrorism financing, and the circumvention of

embargoes.<sup>9</sup> Much ink has been spilled on these problems.<sup>10</sup> This contribution deals with an issue that has been less studied: the private law rules that underpin a DLT transfer. It tries to answer a couple of fundamental questions: Who owns the transferred assets? How can a transfer be reversed in case of a mistake or fraud? What are the legal consequences if the code is hacked and the virtual assets are stolen? What happens in case of death or bankruptcy of the bitcoin holder? 

In the world of physical objects, the answers to these questions are found in private law. Property law in particular enumerates exhaustively the methods by which ownership may be transferred from one party to another. It imposes certain conditions, such as an agreement between the present and the prospective owner.<sup>11</sup> DLT neither requires nor ensures that such an agreement exists.<sup>12</sup> It merely relies on the fulfillment of technological requirements, namely the use of the correct private and public key.<sup>13</sup> The result produced by DLT may thus clash with classic private law. 

On a meta-level lies an even more fundamental problem: the determination of the national law applicable to the transfer. For each and every transaction, a governing national law must be identified.<sup>14</sup> As DLT is a global and virtual transfer mechanism, it is impossible to identify the state which has the closest connection to it. The underlying difficulty is that the technology

is completely delocalized and a-national, while the law is first and foremost made on the national level. Therefore, trying to identify the law applicable to DLT seems like putting a square peg in a round hole.<sup>15</sup>

This article is organized in the following way: The first part will show why private law is relevant for the blockchain although it has been devised as an alternative mechanism to the law. It will outline the numerous types of legal questions that arise and to which precise answers are needed. On the other hand, one must not ignore the specificity of DLT, which produces technically irreversible transfers in a decentralized manner without being connected to a particular state. The second part will demonstrate that these specificities pose obstacles to the application of classic concepts of private law. The third part suggests a way to reconcile the technology with the law and combine them into a meaningful whole. The fourth part will address counterarguments and complications, such as the problems of succession and bankruptcy. The fifth part concludes.
