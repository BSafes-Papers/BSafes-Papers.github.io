## Limitations and Future Directions
In this paper, we have used existing literature on online credibility to examine aspects of credibility assessment as applied to adversary assessment. While we have tried to synthesise the literature, this is not a systematic review and there may be literature or studies that we have not included in this review. A systematic review would enable a comprehensive understanding of the full research regarding online credibility and how it relates to adversary assessment.

This research has informed the proposal of a model for assessing online adversary credibility but ongoing evaluation as to the reliability and validity of these domains and factors is essential. Though the proposed adversary credibility model remains theoretical, it is rooted in empirical literature and provides the basis for future studies to explore and examine the empirical support for this model. Testing the empirical validity of this model could be achieved through an examination of the model’s ability to identify and predict malicious cyber actors based on online information.
