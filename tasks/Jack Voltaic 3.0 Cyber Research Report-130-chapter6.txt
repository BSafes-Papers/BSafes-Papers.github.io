##### APPENDIX G – PRIVATE INDUSTRY TESTIMONIALS

##### G1. Intrepid Response
Intrepid Response is a simple-to-use and affordable, mission-critical, mobile and web-based software solution that enables instant team communication, coordination, and collaboration over a common operating picture. It is uniquely designed to support the day-to-day operations of users in the field as well as incident/emergency management, base security, and surveillance operations. Intrepid Response can integrate with strategic-layer tools that would be found in a command and/or operations center. The software can operate with any cellular network, including Verizon, AT&T, etc. Intrepid Response is the only application of its kind that is FirstNet-certified for public safety, meaning it meets stringent requirements for usability, security, reliability and availability. As such, the application can be utilized in scenarios in which user priority and preemption are enabled.

Intrepid Response is a user-friendly shared situational awareness system that comprises Android/iOS smartphone and web-based applications. The ecosystem provides an integrated suite of capability that comprises realtime geospatial data, emergency notifications, push-totalk voice communications, and multimedia sharing for resource management, team collaboration, and incident management. The platform may be deployed on a customer-hosted on-premise server or via secure cloudhosted solutions, including Amazon Web Services GovCloud. The mobile platform creates a real-time common operating picture for tactical and supervisory units while integrating with strategic tools for top-to-bottom command and control. The Intrepid Response platform supports all major operating systems, including native applications for both iOS and Android, plus browser apps for all significant modern browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer 11, Edge, Firefox, and Safari).

Intrepid Networks was invited to participate in the JV 3.0 exercise as an industry partner to provide its situational awareness and collaboration platform, Intrepid Response, for participants to utilize during the decision-making process. Intrepid Networks’ FirstNet-certified Intrepid Response platform provided a common operating picture and the ability to exchange information in real time across federal, state, and local government and civilian participants. For the JV 3.0 exercise, Intrepid Response provided a turn-by-turn common operating picture of events unfolding as a result of organized cyberattacks in the cities of Charleston and Savannah, providing visualization of valuable data over the Intrepid Response common operating picture to participants instantly, without the added latency of manual interpretation and relay. This capability is a key enabler of more rapid and accurate decision making; dispatch; and response communication, coordination, and collaboration. The capability ensures a more effective response and more timely recognition of seemingly random events as being related (or not related) to an organized and persistent cyberattack.

Situational awareness is a concept that military personnel have discussed and been trained on for decades. Numerous definitions, books, dissertations, and white papers have been published on the concept. For its observations, Intrepid Networks utilized the framework of “perception, comprehension, projection, and prediction,” as discussed in the report Defining and Measuring Shared Situational Awareness by Albert Nofi.48

For the sake of clarity, perception, comprehension, projection, and prediction are defined below: 

• Perception: Gathering information that is available. 

• Comprehension: Understanding the information gathered and the impacts it has on one’s domain. 

• Projection: Estimating how a situation will evolve in the future. 

• Prediction: Evaluating how other forces or events may impact one’s projection.

Intrepid Networks’ observed results are discussed below from the shared situational awareness perspective.

##### G.1.1. Findings
Intrepid Networks’ observations were gathered during the JV participants’ discussion and decisionmaking sessions that occurred throughout the experiment. Intrepid Networks intended to observe how decision-making processes may evolve while utilizing a common operating picture and collaboration platform. As a result of the exercise transitioning to a virtual venue due to COVID-19, Intrepid Networks pivoted from providing live mobile and web application access to participants for communication, collaboration, and coordination to providing static map images that evolved as the exercise proceeded. Intrepid Networks’ observations revealed that even these static map images provided a valuable means for participants to perceive; comprehend; project; and, to some extent, predict outcomes based on the variables realized in the earlier processes. Table 7 lists some issues encountered during the JV 3.0 exercise, Intrepid Networks’ observations, and Intrepid Response capabilities that can address these issues.

##### G.1.2. Analysis
Intrepid Response provides a flexible platform that enables disparate, cross-domain entities to enhance to the situational awareness loop, both individually and collectively. Intrepid Networks’ observations led to the conclusion that a true common operating picture is achievable in cybersecurity response operations by providing a means for cross-domain entities to connect seemingly disparate cybersecurity issues (perception) to a larger, coordinated cyber threat (comprehension). This leads to a more informed response posture, both at the organizational and collective, cross-domain levels (projection and prediction). Ultimately, the Intrepid Response platform expedites activities such as dispatching a particular unit to a threat and, as such, garners a more holistic, cross-domain cyber threat response while tightening the communication loop between organizations. Intrepid Response significantly increases the ability to effectively and efficiently respond to cyberattacks and allows organizations to minimize damage and chaos.

While Intrepid Response enhances situational awareness and collaboration, reducing the impact of cyberattacks, Intrepid Networks recognizes improvements to the platform would provide an even more seamless cross-domain cyber threat response tool that would allow its teams to evolve as our adversaries’ capabilities improve. Intrepid Response provides a flexible, upgradeable platform that can be used out of the box today, but it can be updated to provide increased capability as it becomes available. Intrepid Networks has identified the following features that would evolve Intrepid Response to meet near-term needs for its cyber response teams:

1. Federating channels and/or organizations to provide more rapid information sharing, whether geospatial or specific documentation. This may be realized with an approach that many commercial interteam/intrateam communication tools take, such as providing common workspaces that any organization with a proper invitation may join. This approach would also prevent the ubiquitous “data fog” found in today’s digital era. 

2. Visualizing network- and cyber-related issues and threats on the map to further increase the capability for perception and comprehension in the situational awareness loop. As an example, enhancements can be made to allow for user-friendly input and visualization of vulnerable cyber elements in a geographic area of interest, such as wireless network systems, strategic servers, infrastructure supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, etc., to get a snapshot view of location and other key information about this type of strategic infrastructure vulnerable to cyberattack. 

3. Providing a mechanism for the Intrepid Response map to ingest layers from disparate geospatial systems (for example, traffic light or electrical grid statuses). This would further contribute to a true common operating picture for cross-domain cyber threat responses (expedite perception, comprehension, projection, and prediction). 

4. Integrating data analytics into the Intrepid Response platform for improved automated recognition of a coordinated attack. 5. Implementing an automated after-action reporting feature that is tailored to a nationally accepted format to allow for continuous information sharing; evaluations; and improvements to tactics, policies, and procedures across disparate organizations in various areas of the country

##### APPENDIX H – ALL HAZARDS ANALYSIS (AHA)
Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL’s) AHA tool is a hybrid data and expert knowledge management system that enhances situational awareness and decision making by enabling the development of function-based infrastructure dependency models. The INL team supported the JV 3.0 and Jack Pandemus exercises by using its AHA tool to process open-source government information, regulatory information, and other publicly available data to develop dependency models for the Charleston and Savannah regions, and then performing dependency analyses for these regions. INL created an instance of AHA for the JV exercises and loaded the results of the analysis into it. The JV instance of AHA was utilized to create cascading-impact scenarios that highlighted downstream impacts resulting from the degraded operations at various infrastructure in the energy and water sectors. Scenarios depicting how the regions’ infrastructure are connected and how they were subsequently impacted by the various injects were captured in PowerPoint presentations and videos, which were then utilized in the exercises.

##### H.1. Charleston Exercise Findings
INL supported the energy sector table for the Charleston exercise by supplementing the discussion with pointed questions to the owners and operators from the energy sector. The intent was to facilitate a dialogue to identify how the various stakeholders would respond to the situations presented within each turn. The players from the energy sector did not seem to believe the injects would have a debilitating impact on their operations. This could have been rectified through interacting more with the stakeholders prior to the workshop as well as focusing on the bulk transmission of energy versus the distribution aspects.

The injects in which the electricity substation was compromised resulted in some discussion during the Charleston exercise; however, utility participants thought they would be able to work around the issue. INL believes this was due to a lack of clarity in the scale of the event and language used. If AHA results were shown, INL believes participants’ responses would have been altered. It was not clear from the discussion how Dominion Energy tests firmware configuration changes. Notes of interest included:

• On multiple occasions, a utility participant expressed that someone else within their organization would be responsible for determining whether they were experiencing a cyberattack. 

• The Charleston energy table participants never reached the conclusion they were under attack. As stated below, the advisory/alert and phishing threads played almost no role in the discussion. 

• The virtual environment resulted in some challenges getting injects out of DECIDE® and inserted into the discussion. As a result, the moderator summarized each inject at the being of each turn. 

• Some discussion occurred on the segregation of control and business networks—specifically, which computers were impacted. Participants believed the computer-based injects implied business system computers (i.e., IT, not OT). 

• Local workarounds discussed included disconnecting control devices and operating in manual mode. 

• Participants did not have concerns about being able to access the substation.

##### H.2. Savannah Exercise Findings
INL supported the energy table in the Savannah exercise by supplementing the discussion with pointed questions to the owners and operators from the energy sector. The intent was to facilitate dialogue to identify how the various stakeholders would respond to the situations presented within each turn. The JV instance of AHA was leveraged during the exercise to help participants visualize the infrastructure being discussed during each turn. This seemed to assist with getting the injects to resonate with the participants and teasing out additional context that likely would not have otherwise been discussed.

The inject involving a compromise of natural gas compressor station firmware resulted in significant discussion during the Savannah exercise. The Savannah participants had a mix of cybersecurity and engineering representatives who were able to piece the scenario together. In addition, showing results from AHA resulted in a quick realization that this was a significant event and would result in significant interruptions in service. The cybersecurity representatives quickly picked up on the scene setter injects, which resulted in in-depth gameplay discussions. However, some participants were confused by language used in the inject to describe the events taking place. Notes of interest included:

• Cybersecurity personnel were actively engaged and cyber compromise was rapidly considered. 

• Local workarounds including disconnecting control devices and operating in manual mode. 

• Participants had no concerns about being able to access the substation. Participants discussed potentially involving company security personnel in the response.

##### H.3. Lessons Learned
*Inject planning:* INL supported the development of the injects utilized throughout the turns of the JV exercises. By the time the INL team was brought in to support this area, the inject planning was in progress and the development of the Master Scenario Event List (MSEL) was already underway. If the AHA simulation had been involved from the initial stages of planning, the turns and injects could have allowed for a more robust scenario. Analysis of downstream infrastructure and the associated impacts in the event operations became degraded would identify potential assets that may not have been identified in the JV 3.0 exercises.

*Obfuscation of infrastructure names:* Throughout the process of developing the infrastructure to be included in the scenario, the INL team obfuscated the names of the assets in the JV instance of AHA. This was performed under the assumption the exercise needed to be agnostic regarding the actual infrastructure within the Charleston and Savannah regions. As the exercise played out, it became clear the scenario resonated more with the stakeholders when the actual infrastructure names were used in describing where the events of the scenario were occurring.

*Interaction with service providers:* The primary interaction the INL team had with the service providers involved in the exercise was during the exercise itself. The dialogue with the service providers uncovered nuances about their operations that would have been beneficial to know during inject planning. A brief interaction occurred during the rehearsal sessions, but that discussion was mainly focused on the water sector. During the actual exercise, INL supported the energy table and did not have any direct interaction with the water sector.

Earlier engagement with service providers would allow for better understanding of the presence—or lack thereof—of alternate sources of critical products required for operations. This bottom-up level of detail would allow for more tailored scenario planning that could reveal supply chain issues that may only arise when alternate modes of operations are being leveraged.

*Use of terminology and focus areas:* The primary focus of the impacts on the energy sector during the scenario was on the infrastructure involved with the distribution of the commodity (i.e., distribution substations or distribution pipelines). Impacts on these infrastructure resonate with the downstream asset owners who are depending on the commodity being provided, but the service providers were generally able to rectify the consequences of impacts at this level fairly quickly by either switching to manual operations or redirecting the load to a different set of distribution infrastructure. If the focus area of the impacts were to be shifted to the bulk transport of commodities (i.e., transmission substations or compressor stations), the impacts would be on a broader scale, but the response by the service providers to control the impact would not be as easily identifiable. Consideration should be given to transmission infrastructure in planning future injects and scenarios.

##### APPENDIX I – CIRI FORT-TO-PORT DISRUPTION

##### Introduction
A primary objective of the JV 3.0 exercises was to understand the impact of cyber-originating disruptions on power projection. To address this objective, this appendix focuses on interactions between communications/IT systems and their impact on the Maritime Transportation System (MTS). Specifically, the report uses data sources—publicly available geographic information system (GIS) data and movement schedules provided by SDDC—to quantify the impact of cyber-originating disruptions based on known historical incidents. The incidents considered are consistent with the JV 3.0 injects, which took a gray-zone approach. The baseline behavior as well as the impact of a disruption as computed by a multicommodity network flow optimization algorithm (an extension of work by Boland et al.) was validated by interactions with stakeholders at SDDC and others.<sup>49</sup>

The fort-to-port analyses developed for these exercises extend the Port Disruptions Tool (PDT)— developed by the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI)—to quantify the impact of such disruptions. Beyond the practical impact on understanding power projection, CIRI believes such analyses extend the current state of the art reflected in datasets such as Harmonized Grids of Critical Infrastructures in Europe (commonly known as “HARCI-EU”), a grid-based approach to critical infrastructure risk assessment.<sup>50</sup>

Given the increased dependence on communications/IT systems because of the pandemic, the widespread intrusion of nation-state actors into U.S. critical infrastructure systems, and civil unrest targeting such systems, the ability to model and prepare for such events is an increasingly essential capability for both government and private industry.51

##### Critical Infrastructure Networks
At a high level, CIRI has created a multilayered network whose layers correspond to critical infrastructure networks. This study focuses on interactions between the communications/IT sectors and their impact on the transportation sector. If desired, future work could integrate dependencies on the electrical power system, building on expertise gained via the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation and Characterization Systems at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).<sup>52</sup>

Transportation Sector: Intermodal transportation networks were directly extracted from the GIS data sources listed above. These GIS files were processed, via the NetworkX package from Los Alamos National Laboratory, into directed networks that use the L-space representation.<sup>53</sup> In the L-space representation for transportation networks, vertices within a network correspond to locations, edges correspond to roadways/railways, etc.<sup>54</sup> The SC railway network (DS-TR.N-4) resulting from the GIS file (DS-TR.N-3) has 2,732 nodes; this is similar in size to 2,500, the average number of nodes in railway networks provided by a 2013 survey of L-space representations for transportation networks.<sup>55</sup> To optimize commodity flows across such a network, however, CIRI needed to reduce the size of the network. For example, the paper by Boland et al. in the transportation network optimization literature considered benchmarks for fixed graphs that were 20–30 nodes, 230–700 arcs, and 40–100 commodities.<sup>56</sup> Therefore, we employed various approaches to reduce the size of the transportation network graphs. The approach we adopted, based on a paper by Buchsbaum and Westbrook, constructs a hierarchy tree to adaptively collapse groups of transportation network locations into a single node according to their geographic proximity to one another.<sup>57</sup> Depending upon the degree of resolution desired for an analysis, different levels of detail in the network are preserved (including properties such as travel time and cost through a subgraph). More details about this approach can be provided by CIRI on request. Note that once this transformation occurs, the networks no longer may be considered as using an L-space representation.

##### Cyber Disruptions with Secondary Impacts on Power Projection
This section provides an overview of three types of cyber-originating disruptions to power projection based on real-world incidents: 

1. Train derailment due to compromised rail-control signals 

2. Rail delays due to communications network degradation 

3. Traffic congestion resulting from cyberattacks

##### Baseline Context
The context for discussion of these disruptions is the SDDC Baseline Plan of Action and Milestones that was provided as part of the JV 3.0 exercises. The time-location diagram in figure 28 plots intermodal road and rail movements from Fort Stewart to the North Charleston Terminal used by the 841st Transportation Battalion command. Commercial line haul, convoy, and train movements over the course of the exercise time line are shown. The accompanying table presents the dates used to instantiate the diagram. Times from source to destination along optimal routes were calibrated via a combination of feedback from SDDC and Google Maps, as discussed in more detail below.

##### Disruption 1 (D1): Derailment via Infrared Hack
In the JV 3.0 exercise, the MSEL included an inject on Tuesday morning during which “Norfolk Southern notified SDDC that a major rail line servicing Fort Stewart to the Port of Charleston was taken offline to investigate malfunctions in a switching station.”

One possible cause of switching station malfunctions includes spoofing or jamming switching the control signals. Such an incident occurred in a Polish tram hacking attack in 2008. On this occasion, a 14-yearold boy used a homemade infrared transmitter to trip rail switches and redirect trains. Four trams were derailed, and a dozen people injured.<sup>58</sup> The device, made from a television controller, was capable of controlling all junctions on the line, and the boy had written in his schoolbook where the best junctions for moving trains around were.<sup>59</sup>

After consulting with SDDC, the team learned that most rail switches in the contiguous United States are controlled by line of sight. Although the rail companies have a smart system for checking the rail via a networked service, track switching depends on radio signals sent from the engine to the switch. Rather than derailment via infrared signal hacking, a replay attack could be employed to spoof a signal and switch the track. Alternatively, a jammed radio signal could cause derailment because a train may need to adjust its speed when traversing a junction. Beyond rail delays, a secondary impact of a derailment on the communications network could be a severed fiber cable because fiber is also placed along rail rights-of-way.

*Data Sources and Calibration:* To model such a disruption, the CIRI team constructed a rail transportation network based upon publicly available GIS data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Transportation Map (DS-TR.N-3) as well as the Federal Railroad Administration’s rail junctions (DS-TR.N-5). Vehicle schedules provided by SDDC were used to determine when trains left Fort Stewart and when they were expected to arrive at the Port of Charleston. The CIRI/ACI team consulted with SDDC to calibrate the baseline routes computed, the duration of the train route (18 hours), and the speed of the train. The duration of the train on the route, as noted during the discussion, does not include staging, prepping, and loading of material onto the train. Other factors that may affect train speed include tunnels, bridge limitations, terrain, and environment (e.g., flooding); these were not modeled.

Figure 29 illustrates the regional rail network provided by the USGS National Transportation Map (shown in orange). One key takeaway is that in the case of the Port of Charleston, there appears to be one direct route from Fort Stewart to the Port of Charleston (shown in green). This could lead to a single point of rail failure. A second route through Columbia, though less direct, provides a potential alternative route. The impact of a derailment on the SDDC Plan of Action and Milestones is illustrated in figure 30.

The derailment CIRI modeled occurs shortly after the junction at Yemassee, where the line from Fort Stewart branches between Charleston and Columbia, SC. Note that to get the pieces from the derailed May 1 train, line haul trucks (shown in orange) are sent from the point of disruption (just after the railway splits in Yemassee) to the North Charleston Terminal. Based on fieldwork with Port Everglades and the Florida East Coast Railway, CIRI estimated a derailment would take 2 days to clear. As a result, the train on May 2 (shown in dashed black lines) as well as possibly May 3 (not shown) are affected. There may be three options to address this delay: wait to move the train until the derailment has been cleared; use another mode of transportation to the port; or, if possible, reroute the trains scheduled to depart around the obstructed railway.

The first case in the time-location diagram illustrates that it may be possible to reschedule the May 2 train to May 3 or 4 (shown in dashed orange). In the case of May 3, the rescheduled train might interfere with the train originally scheduled for May 3, but this would cause less delay at the port if the order of arrival of pieces were significant. In the case of May 4, other alternative modes of transport could be useful. There may be a risk associated with reducing the slack between shipments on rail.

The second response option would have the fort move pieces originally scheduled for the May 2 train via commercial long haul. It would be important to consider the risks of increased gate utilization to determine the impact of a gate outage (e.g., gate operating system [GOS] failure). Queueing theory provides a formalism for exploring such considerations and is part of the PDT discrete-event simulation tool. In addition, increased dependencies on trucking companies could increase the impact of disrupting such a company’s telemetry network.

A third option, if the derailment allowed it, would be to reroute the scheduled trains. This might make sense if the time frame or risk associated with the option were more optimal than the time frame or risk associated with the first and second options. SDDC stated that such an option would likely not be chosen. Nonetheless, this analysis considers the cyber-physical risks of rerouting a train.

According to SDDC, this alternative route is determined by the rail company (Norfolk Southern). The PDT multicommodity network flow optimizer selected a route through Columbia to explore secondary effects on transportation and communications systems as goods move via this alternative route (shown in figure 31).

Rerouting vehicle movements has secondary effects on social, local transportation, and communications domains. First, from a social standpoint, JV 3.0 chat logs suggest that rerouting movements would require a battalion commander to request support from a higher command: “841st Battalion: Roadblock requires support from higher command, battalion commander will submit a written doc to command requesting support to look at diverting assets from brigade to request follow on actions. Engage with Base and Port Readiness Committee.” Second, local transportation systems in Charleston (or even Columbia) may be affected if pieces are rerouted via vehicle or train. Figure 32 illustrates a local view of train routes taken through Charleston under normal (yellow) and disrupted (red) conditions. The section on Disruption 3 (D3) later in this appendix demonstrates how the choice of route may affect the ability of an adversary to further disrupt movements. Third, the impact of rerouting vehicle movements on the communication domain is the focus of the next section, “Disruption 2 (D2).”

*Key Takeaways: *

• There is one primary rail route from Fort Stewart to Charleston. 

• Jamming or spoofing of rail signals can result in derailment. 

• According to SDDC, a derailment in the city would be worse than in a rural area. 

• But rerouting from a rural area (either by rail or road) can still affect city transportation movements and cause delays in train arrivals to the port. 

• The choice of route is up to the rail company (private industry), but it must be approved by higher command.

##### Disruption 2 (D2): Rail Delays Due to Communications Network Degradation
Railroad companies are increasingly adopting digital communications as a cheaper and more easily maintained technology than copper. For example, Norfolk Southern “uses cell phones to transmit data between field sites and central offices.”<sup>60</sup> CSX Transportation has conductors and field workers

communicate with each other through cell phones, including applications on the phones. These applications include reporting systems for conductors, services for track inspectors and signal maintainers, and applications for communications with truck drivers and intermodal yard operators. Wi-Fi is also used for communications in remote locations, with railroad companies building their own networks to cover regions with no cell coverage.

During the JV 3.0 exercises, some injects might have been caused by disruptions to a railroads’ communications networks. For example, on Monday at 6:01 p.m., county transportation officials discovered a wireless router connected to a traffic box in a remote location. Such routers could also have been deployed in a remote region of a railroad’s wireless network and thereby affected communications. In addition, on Tuesday at 3:47 p.m., Norfolk Southern had its crews verify that rail lines were clear and had not been tampered with or damaged. However, communications required to use the rail could have been damaged.

In an alternative scenario, however, communications required for using the rail could have been damaged. During discussion of the scenario with SDDC, it was observed that if a cell tower were to go down, other towers in the area could pick up service, and even if a signal were lost, it would be just an annoyance. However, during the exercise, stakeholders often commented on their concern over communications going down. In addition, degradation of the cell phone network could result in loss of data upon which many of the previously mentioned digital communications adopted by railroad companies depend.

An additional concern is man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, UAVs could provide a Wi-Fi signal that could be used to steal signals from a rail company’s rural wireless networks. UAVs are used to patrol by railroads because rail police cannot access remote locations. Thus, such a capability could be used by an adversary. SDDC confirmed that whether the rail route is covered by satellite, cell, or Wi-Fi, such a threat model is worth exploring further.

Data Sources and Calibration: In addition to the aforementioned data sources provided by USGS, this analysis uses the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data’s (HIFLD’s) GIS data on cell phone tower locations (DS-CM.N-3). These locations were used to compute a Voronoi diagram to determine which cell phone towers provided which communications along the railway network.

Figure 33 illustrates the cell phone tower coverage along several rail routes from Fort Stewart to Charleston’s North Terminal. The interaction between the choice of route taken and communications networks should be considered to protect potentially sensitive information about movements.

For example, changing the route in response to a derailment, as in Disruption 1, affects the cell phone towers (and potentially companies) upon which power projection depends. This is shown in more detail for Charleston in figure 34.

*Key Takeaways: *

• Route choice may affect the exposure of data to adversaries, depending upon the communications networks utilized. 

• Exposure to UAV-based MITM attacks may be worse in rural areas, where railroad companies rely on wireless networks. 

• Technologies such as Stingray may also enable one to use MITM methods to access operational data via cell phone signals used by emerging applications employed by rail companies.

##### Disruption 3 (D3): Traffic Congestion Resulting from Cyberattacks
In addition to potentially altering a movement’s risk posture in the cyber domain, rerouting vehicle movements in response to an initial disruption may also increase risk relative to other domains. For example, by diverting rail movements through the more heavily populated area of a municipality (e.g., due to the rural disruption in D1), protestors may have more chances to disrupt the route once the train enters the city. An example of such an occurrence is the cyberattacks and reinforced protests that affect the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. Similar disruptions might be possible during power projection through a city.

During the JV 3.0 exercises, several MSEL injects involved protestors blocking or otherwise affecting traffic. For example, on Monday morning, the main access gate sporadically failed to open, and on Tuesday afternoon, main terminal gates were the site of protests. A failed GOS can cause significant traffic congestion at a port. For example, the NotPetya ransomware affected one Maersk terminal where trucks collected “bumper to bumper, farther than [one] could see.”<sup>61</sup> The PDT has been used to model the impact of GOS outages.<sup>62</sup> This scenario considers the impact of protests causing the rerouting of rail and vehicle movements through a common cell phone tower.

In addition, exercise chat logs reflect related concerns by exercise participants. First, stakeholders were concerned about congestion on roadways, especially when combined with rail line degradation: “SDDC concerned about crash on I95 (other Feds not aware) and impact on degrading Ft. Stewart movement; especially in light of rail line degradation.” Furthermore, congestion resulting from protests can degrade the ability to keep military and commercial traffic separate: “841st wondering how the protests and gate issues would affect one’s ability to keep military and commercial traffic separate. They could manually validate TWIC but a military truck could go in the commercial side of the port.”

*Data Sources and Calibration:* The same datasets as those mentioned previously were used in this analysis. In addition, vehicle movements by roadway were obtained from SDDC that were aligned with the JV 3.0 scenario time line. The choice of roadway routes was validated using Google Maps for traveling from I-26 in the northwest corner of the city to North Charleston Terminal. Note that the primary and secondary road optimal routes computed by the PDT optimizer align with the routes chosen by Google Maps for the same source and destination. The computed optimal routes approximately follow the GIS roadways because they were computed on GIS transportation networks.

reduced in size via the aforementioned method based on hierarchy trees.63 Vehicles moved on the roadway at 55 miles per hour and were considered late if they arrived after more than 30 minutes (Google Maps estimated that the trip would take 9 minutes).

Figure 35 illustrates baseline road and rail routes through Charleston (shown in green and blue, respectively) as well as rerouted rail routes in response to D1 (shown in red). As a result of this response to D1, there appears to be a potential single point of disruption along the Mark Clark Expressway where road movements are affected. Moreover, this point of convergence within a small geographic region opens up opportunities for communications network disruptions or data gathering, as discussed in D2.

CIRI modeled a 1-day protest. This protest would directly affect commercial line haul, which travels from fort to port if held sometime during April 27–30. In the context of train derailment mitigation actions (D1), a protest held on May 1 could interfere with additional line haul traffic carrying pieces from the derailed train. In the context of response actions to transport pieces from the May 2 train, a protest on May 2–4 could interfere with either commercial long-haul trucks carrying rescheduled pieces or rerouted trains moving via Columbia.

Specifically, if the protestors were able to simultaneously disrupt the nearby rail line taken by rerouted trains, another mitigation would have to be considered for rail as well. We note that, alternatively, unrelated protests might also occur in Columbia (as described in D1) to disrupt rail movement but have less effect on long-haul and convoy routes.

Figure 36 illustrates the recomputed optimal road and rail routes (shown in red and purple, respectively), given a hybrid disruption consisting of a rural train derailment and city protestors demonstrating along the highway. We note that this shifts the intersection of rail, traffic, and cell phone towers to a new, single geographic region at the intersection of Remount Road and Virginia Avenue

*Key Takeaways:* 

• Rerouting traffic can result in new single points of failure across multiple critical infrastructure domains. 

• Planners should be aware of changing risk due to the data or stakeholder dependencies of secondary and tertiary routes and time delays resulting from disrupted movements.

##### Broader Impact
The scenarios considered in this appendix are based on historical incidents in which MTS stakeholders were disrupted via their communications/IT systems. The function of the MTS depends upon crossorganizational coordination among multiple stakeholder organizations. Cyber-originating disruptions experienced by these stakeholders, such as those listed in table 9, might be leveraged by an adversary during coordinated gray-zone disruptions like those exercised during JV 3.0.<sup>64</sup> Some Port of Charleston stakeholders opined that this level of dependence creates a requirement for information sharing and analysis organizations focused on the needs of specific regions.

In table 9, each incident is grouped by the type of stakeholder that was affected; the corresponding affected systems and Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification identifiers (CAPEC-IDs) are also listed.<sup>65</sup>

##### Future Work
This research, jointly conducted by the ACI and CIRI, has sought to quantify the impact of disruptions on cross-organizational, interinfrastructure dependencies. This appendix has focused on cyberoriginating disruptions to the MTS at a regional and municipal level. However, prior work sponsored by CIRI focused on a detailed port view and the impact of disruptions to services provided by port stakeholder communications/IT networks. A detailed study of the impact of a GOS outage on various stakeholders as well as the impact that various stakeholders have on overall port operation may be found in CIRI’s 2019 Simulation Winter Conference paper.66 Such cross-organizational dependencies and how they affect overall port operation may be of particular interest to NATO and United States Indo-Pacific Command given programs such as the Belt and Road Initiative. Ongoing work in the communications/IT sector is looking to emulate and quantify the impact of targeted ransomware attacks on automated shipping ports. This work is actively being developed in collaboration with Ports of Auckland, New Zealand, and Mandiant/FireEye industrial control system team members.

Other scenarios could be considered that integrate additional critical infrastructure systems. For example, the work of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation and Characterization Systems, the testbed for which is hosted at

UIUC, could be integrated to analyze the impact of cyberattacks on the electrical power grid in the context of the MTS. Figure 37 illustrates the geographic proximity of electrical power lines, substations (dark-green points), and power plants (lime-green points) at a regional and municipal level. Note that the North Charleston Terminal has its own biomass power plant, according to the available DHS HIFLD data. Such research would also build on previous work by Weaver to model cyber-physical dependencies within the bulk electric power system, with a focus on protection schemes.<sup>67</sup>

##### Conclusions
The MTS accounts for more than $4.6 trillion of annual economic activity—nearly a quarter of the U.S. gross domestic product.<sup>68</sup> Preparing for a major disruption is key to building resilience for such critical infrastructure.

The PDT provides stakeholders with the ability to accurately model commodity flows through a shipping port, introduce a wide range of cyber and/or physical disruptions, and calculate various economic impacts of such disruptions. The PDT enables stakeholders to quantify the impact of crossinfrastructure, interorganizational disruptions in an evolving natural and man-made environment. To conduct the research presented in this appendix, CIRI extended the PDT to include fort to port. The supporting framework used to provide analyses such as this one is readily applicable to other municipalities, such as Savannah, GA, and other commercial strategic seaports.

##### APPENDIX J – REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE (RDD) SIMULATION
In force projection operations, the RDD is a critical factor for commanders. The RDD is the date when commanders need their unit’s equipment in the theater of operation to effectively execute their missions. Should equipment not arrive by the RDD, commanders are forced to consider alternative options that may not prove advantageous for timely and effective mission accomplishment. During JV 3.0, cyber incidents caused both physical and electronic disruptions to commercial critical infrastructure required to ensure equipment meets the RDD suspense. The RDD simulation seeks to inform commanders about potential impacts to RDD when conducting force projection operations in a contested environment.

For the JV 3.0 scenario, a brigade-sized task force with approximately 2,300 pieces of equipment was tasked to deploy overseas in a Sealift Emergency Deployment Readiness Exercise. The hypothetical orders to initiate the exercise came on April 29, 2020 (turn 0), with an RDD of June 1, 2020. This simulation analyzes two potential alternatives after the events of turn 5 in JV 3.0. During this turn, the ports in both cities were forced to close due to cyber and physical issues. The various incidents that led to this closure included traffic congestion, protests, cyber incidents creating delays for both rail and line haul equipment, and the listing of a ship in port that resulted in the spillage of containers. Given these events, this simulation explores the number of days associated with two primary alternatives: waiting for the original port to remediate physical and cyber issues or relocating to a new port. The goal of the simulation is to generate a distribution that describes the number of days and to develop probabilities associated with the original RDD of June 1, 2020.

The simulation will take a standard Monte Carlo approach to estimate the total number of days it takes to execute key processes. The processes involved governing the options required to handle equipment stranded at the original port, equipment that was moving to the original port, and equipment that was yet to depart. Each of the key processes are represented with a triangle distribution whose parameters (minimum, maximum, and mean) were informed by data collected during the JV 3.0 events and from discussions with participants postevent. Table 10 provides brief descriptions of the various processes and their parameters used in the simulation.

The ACI looked at two options for each alternative. The process diagram for each alternative is shown in figure 38. For the alternative of remaining at the original port, there is a simulation that governs container spillage into the channel and an option that focuses only on remediating the various incidents, without including the spillage. In the case of relocating ports, the ACI presents the results of moving to ports both 200 and 1,000 miles from the point of departure. The following sections discuss the assumptions and results associated with each alternative.

##### J.1. Results: Remain at Original Port
For our first result, we look at staying with the original port, given the requirement to clear the channel. In this alternative, equipment that is at the port remains, and equipment moving to the port will have to return after traffic and protest issues have been resolved. We assume that movement to the port will not begin until the port is reopened, which includes establishing physical security, remediating malware, and clearing the channel. The remediation, reconfiguration, and movement for both rail and line haul occur in series, but are compared in parallel. We ran 10,000 simulations using 50 miles as the distance from point of origin to the port. In figure 39, a histogram of the results is shown on the left, and the minimum, maximum, and mean for each process is shown on the right.

Using the histogram, we can calculate the probability that the equipment will make RDD by summing up the number of simulations that occurred in less than or equal to 28 days (the number of days until June 1, 2020). In this case, there is a 23.4-percent chance that the equipment will make it by June 1, indicating that the scenario successfully disrupted force projection operations. Figure 39 illustrates that fixing the port (malware remediation and clearing the channel) is the most time-consuming process associated with this alternative.

Table 11 includes probabilities for additional days, indicating that it requires at least 40 days (arrival date of June 13, 2020) for a 95-percent probability.

Our second option for this alternative is to look at a situation in which there are no issues with the channel. In this case, we have removed a significant physical effect of the cyber intrusion to determine how much impact remediating the other intrusions (traffic lights, rail failure, and truck crash) will have on RDD. Using the same assumptions as before, we ran 10,000 simulations using 50 miles as the distance from point of origin to the port. Figure 40 shows a histogram of the results on the left and the minimum, maximum, and mean for each process on the right.

In this situation, we see there is a 77.25-percent chance that the equipment will make it by June 1, indicating that the scenario (minus channel issues) created some disruption to force projection operations. Table 12 provides probabilities for additional days, showing that the probability goes above 90 percent for 30 days.

In terms of the processes, we see that vessel travel and the port operations at the original port take the most time. The remediation of commercial assets (rail, line-haul, and port IT) follow as most timeconsuming and with the most variance.

##### J.2. Results: Shift to a New Port
This result looks at the alternative in which the commander chooses to shift ports. The first case considers the new port to be 200 miles away. For this alternative, we assume that the identification of a new port occurs first, followed by adjustment of the contracts for both rail and line haul (as well as convoy planning). Based on the parameters for the distributions, traffic congestion and return-tobase movement are dominated by replanning the new port and therefore are not considered. The remediation, replanning, reconfiguring, and movement for rail, line haul, and convoy occur in series. Finally, we assume that the equipment stranded at the original port will make it to the seaport of debarkation at the same time as or before the other equipment. Again, we ran 10,000 simulations and produced a graphic (figure 41) showing a histogram of the results on the left and analyses of the processes on the right.

For this alternative, there is a 1.28-percent chance that the equipment will make it by RDD, with over 95-percent probability of it occurring after 40 days (June 13). It follows that shifting to a port further away will reduce the probability; for a port 1,000 miles away (e.g., shifting from Charleston to Beaumont, Texas), there is a less-than-1-percent chance that the equipment will make RDD. Table 13 shows a breakdown of the probabilities by days for the port 200 miles away as well as the port 1,000 miles away.

Looking at the process analysis, replanning and reconfiguration dominate the time line, with reconfiguration taking a longer time than in option 1. Though the time for the movement processes increases and adds to the delay, the replanning and reconfiguration still take the longest after vessel movement and port operations.

##### J.3. Conclusions
Based on this simulation of the events occurring after turn 5, we find that cyber incidents do have an impact on force projection in a contested environment. Although the alternative that relied on the original port was preferable to the one that required changing ports, it still did not guarantee the equipment would make RDD. Yet, commanders should consider the significant time investment required for relocating to a different port and seek ways to improve the probabilities associated with the original port alternative. The conclusions from this simulation are as follows.

1. Proactive cybersecurity: The physical event resulting from the cyber incident created the most significant delay in the original port alternative. Stakeholders must remain proactive and identify potential threats early, before they fester. 

2. United States Coast Guard (USCG): In the event of a deployment, SDDC and deploying units must ensure they notify the USCG unit responsible for the targeted port. The USCG cyber assets can assist in security, detection, and prevention. 

3. Though shifting ports seems to be the least favorable option, if a spillage includes potentially hazardous materials, then the time required to clear the channel will increase. This information should be considered a commander’s critical information requirement. 

4. Shifting ports may result in follow-on attacks, creating a cascading effect (recreating the situation at subsequent ports and adding to the delay).

##### APPENDIX K – DSCA/DSCIR
Directive-Type Memorandum 17-007 details the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) approach to using defense coordinating elements (DCEs) or officers (DCOs) for cyber capabilities on a regional basis. Defense Support to Cyber Incident Response (DSCIR) is provided within the framework of Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) and may include direct, on-location support; remote support; or a combination of both. To protect, prevent, and mitigate great property damage and human suffering, DoD cyber teams are permitted to: (1) gain familiarity with critical infrastructure networks and systems; and (2) assist critical infrastructure owners or assets that are essential for the functioning of a society and economy.<sup>69</sup>

*Role of the DCE/DCO:* The DCE/DCO will be the DoD representative and liaison to the federal lead agency in the disaster area and provide situational awareness to DoD agencies. The DCE/DCO also serves as liaison to senior leaders and state, local, and other federal agencies; validates the Resource Request Form; and accepts the mission assignment from the federal coordinating officer. DCEs/DCOs assist with receiving, staging, onward movement, and integration of units/personnel; recommend military resources to meet request requirements; forward mission assignments to United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM); provide a link to the base support installation; coordinate administrative and logistical support to deployed military forces; control small DoD units and resources in the disaster area; and maintain accounting records for reimbursement (with U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff G-8 augmentation).

Charleston and Savannah would be covered by a DCE/DCO under Federal Emergency Management Agency Region IV, which consists of all eight of the southeastern states (Alabama, Florida, GA, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, SC, and Tennessee). The DCE/DCO’s mission is broad and encompasses support to any federal lead agency that is conducting homeland defense operations or DSCA support within the USNORTHCOM area of responsibility. Mainly, this DCE/DCO group is solely responsible for validating and processing requests for DoD assistance in coordination with and in support of the primary federal and state agencies. DHS is embedded in 10 of the critical infrastructure sectors.

Requesting DSCIR: When a request for DSCIR is received and approved, DCEs/DCOs will carry out DSCIR as directed in DoDD 3025.18 and DoDI 3025.21, Defense Support of Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, and will be evaluated using C.A.R.R.L.L. (see section 4.2.4 of this report)<sup>70</sup>. Legal documents, such as memoranda of understanding (MOUs), memoranda of agreement, nondisclosure agreements, or other appropriate legal documents requested by the DoD, must be signed and written acknowledgment and permission giving DoD access to provide support must be given before DSCIR is provided.<sup>71</sup>

Federal military commanders and DoD component heads and civilians may accept federal requests for DSCIR under immediate response authority in support of a cyber incident response.<sup>72</sup> Industrial control systems and their supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) capabilities are often quite advanced, but are likely to run out of personnel and resources quickly. United States Strategic Command, USNORTHCOM, and United States Pacific Command commanders have the following responsibilities:

• Planning and executing DSCIR operations in coordination with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and the combatant commanders; 

• Incorporating DSCIR into joint training and exercise programs in coordination with the CJCS and in consultation with the appropriate federal departments and agencies and the National Guard; 

• If they have been designated as the supported commander, coordinating with supporting DoD components to distribute all reimbursement for assistance received; 

• If they have been designated as the supported commander, coordinating with the CJCS, the assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense and global security, and any supporting commands on military preparations and operations; and 

• Informing the secretary of defense, through the CJCS and by the most expeditious means possible, of any actions taken to provide immediate response to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate great property damage.<sup>73</sup>

*DoD recommendations:* The DoD cyber team recommends the following to prepare and protect assets in the event of a major cyber incident.

When requesting DSCIR support, a civil authority must consider the following questions: 

• Who at state level is the decision maker for requesting federal cyber support? 

• Where can a DSCIR request be injected into the DoD enterprise? 

• Should USNORTHCOM integrate DCOs/DCEs into the validation process or retain them at USNORTHCOM? 

• How do supported combatant commands from USNORTHCOM ensure situational awareness and unity of effort when Title 10 forces are being employed? 

• Would this scenario amount to a “significant cyber incident” (see definition below), therefore requiring the activation of the executive Unified Coordination Group and centralized control? 

» “Significant cyber incident. A cyber incident that is (or group of related cyber incidents that together are) likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people.”<sup>74</sup>

In addition, one must consider the following preparations to avoid or safely resolve a major cyber incident: 

• Ensure teams possess a high level of expertise in the cybersecurity of traditional IT as well as operational technology (OT) systems; 

• Assess force structure and team composition; 

• Standardize critical infrastructure training and equipping; and 

• Enhance expertise through exercises that integrate government, academia, and public and private sector cybersecurity professionals.
